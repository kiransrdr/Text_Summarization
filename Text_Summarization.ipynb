            "This is the place where the Queen Mother exchanged nods with a complete stranger who was sitting in a warm bath . It was where Princess Margaret allegedly took cocaine with the Rolling Stones at a concert , and where a young Cliff Richard had announced he had found Christ at a Billy Graham ` crusade ' . Oh yes , and in 1896 Buffalo Bill Cody put on his Wild West Show there .  But now the bulldozers are growling with impatience . Soon the demolition men will be moving in . With an # 8 billion project at stake -- now that London Mayor Boris Johnson has given the scheme his blessing -- they will not take long to reduce to rubble the art deco façade famous around the world and the vast buildings on 77 valuable acres behind it .  Progress , if that is the right word , comes in many guises . In this instance , Earls Court exhibition centre , for more than a century a palace of excitement and dreams in the heart of London , is coming down to make way for -- but you already knew -- town houses and flats .  Scroll down for video  Earl 's Court , where the Queen Mother exchanged nods with model Anne Callaghan who was sitting in a warm bath at the 1986 Ideal Home Exhibition , is to be demolished  Earls Court exhibition centre , for more than a century a palace of excitement and dreams in the heart of London , is coming down to make way for town houses and flats  The demolition men will soon be moving in to Earl 's Court after an # 8bn project to turn it into houses and flats was backed by Boris Johnson  The sad moment when the edifice starts to crumble will unlock a billion nostalgic memories . For generations of young lovers and families , Earls Court has resonated with our most fundamental needs -- home-making , romance and entertainment .  What brought the late Queen Mother into contact with a bathing man there was the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition , which was staged at Earls Court over many years . It was the mid-Eighties and she had declared the highly popular exhibition open . Then , as she began a tour of the exhibits , she steered a course through the kitchens towards the bathrooms -- and there was this young man demonstrating one of the luxuries of life .  Their brief exchange was not exactly a deep conversation , more an exchange of smiles and nods . The poor chap was in no position to bow . He was said to be ` almost in a prayer ' of relief when she moved on .  The waiting cameramen resisted the temptation to capture the introduction , but demonstrating wise discretion , they instead photographed a subsequent encounter between the Queen Mother and a female model wearing a swimsuit .  Princess Margaret -LRB- left -RRB- allegedly took cocaine with the Rolling Stones at a concert at Earl 's Court after she was invited back stage by Mick Jagger -LRB- right -RRB-  Take That perform at the BBC Music Awards on December 11 - which could be one of the last events to be held at the famous venue  As for Princess Margaret 's visit backstage with the Stones , this emerged in a scurrilous biography of the Queen 's sister in which it was alleged she was invited by Mick Jagger to a Stones concert at Earls Court and partook of the drug with them in their dressing rooms before the concert , watched by 23,000 people , had begun .  ` An amusing drug , do n't you think ? ' she was quoted as saying to one of the band 's female assistants .  For Cliff Richard , the exhibition centre holds very different memories . He was 26 and already a big star when he went to Earls Court to see American evangelist Billy Graham . He listened to Graham -- now 95 and in poor health -- and that night he joined dozens of others in the audience shuffling down to the front of the stage . Suddenly there he was on stage declaring to 27,000 people he had found Christ .  Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift with the Victoria 's Secret models at the underwear chain 's fashion show , held at Earl 's Court earlier this month  Others have packed into the great auditorium for very different reasons . On July 16 , 1939 , just six weeks before the outbreak of World War II , Oswald Mosley filled it to overflowing with his blackshirts for a mass rally of the British Union of Fascists .  With the party 's white lightning bolt insignia hanging from the walls , Mosley 's ranting speech raised to a fever of excitement the 50,000 who had squeezed standing into a space built to seat half that number .  ` Mosley , Mosley , Mosley , ' they cried until his name reverberated around the walls and could be heard outside in the streets . That Earls Court gathering was then , and remains now , the biggest indoor political rally ever held in Britain .  When Mosley hired Earl Court , it was only two years old in its present form . Back in 1887 , when it was originally opened on what had been waste land by the engineer-businessman John R. Whitley , it was an open-air space surrounded by covered stands , rather as football stadia are today . It was called Earls Court after the Earl of Zetland , who owned the freehold .  One of Whitley 's first major successes was Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show , which pulled in 15,000 visitors a day including , on one occasion , the whole of Harrow School , possibly including the young Winston Churchill who had just started there .  The ground was turned into a lake in order to accommodate Captain Paul Boyton 's Water Show , an aquatic stunts display featuring the country 's first ` water toboggan ' .  In 1895 there was the Empire Of India Exhibition supported by four maharajahs , with spectacular displays and a 300ft ferris wheel that could carry 1,600 people at a time , revolving in eight minutes -LRB- though on one occasion when it broke down the passengers were suspended for four-and-a-half hours -RRB- .  In a po-faced editorial , the magazine The Builder described the wheel as ` a foolish kind of sensational toy ... carrying coachloads of fools round in a vertical circle ' .  Then came World War I and Earls Court became a refugee camp for Belgians whose country had been overrun by the German army . Part of it became a bus depot . But when new owners took it over in 1935 , they decided to build a vast , triangular building over the site .  Cliff Richard was 26 and already a big star when he went to Earls Court to see American evangelist Billy Graham . Suddenly there he was on stage declaring to 27,000 people he had found Christ  Earls Court was also where Spice Girl Geri Halliwell wore her famous Union flag dress at The Brit awards  Ironically , at the outbreak of war this huge edifice that Mosley had hired to promote his black propaganda served the war effort brilliantly , and was perfect as a factory making and testing barrage balloons in the heart of London where they were most needed .  The post-war years and the country 's need for glamour and entertainment revealed Earls Court to be the most flexible venue in the country . In 1948 there was the Aquashow , starring Johnny Weissmuller , who had gone from being an Olympic swimming champion to Hollywood 's Tarzan .  Earls Court was the perfect place for Tarzan , for it had been built with a permanent swimming pool covered by a 750-ton concrete floor which slid in and out of sight at the touch of a button .  The Queen Mother with Lord Rothermere at the opening of the 1970 Ideal Home Exhibition  They packed in to see Cinderella On Ice and other ice-borne shows . During one panto in 1949 , one of the skating clowns stopped to plant a kiss on the bald head of a mild-looking chap sitting with his family in the front row .  It was Clement Attlee , Britain 's post-war Labour prime minister .  A strong royal link also began to take root as the Royal Tournament -- the world 's largest military tattoo , held by the Armed Forces annually -- was established there , along with the Motor Show and the International Boat Show .  For Billy Graham , it was a natural place to hold his mass meetings . And then Earls Court was discovered , as it were , by the pop groups .  Pink Floyd first played there in 1973 , and had other full-capacity appearances in 1980 , and again in 1981 , selling out the entire 85,000 tickets in just four hours .  Thirteen years later , in 1994 , they had just started their set when a stand holding 1,200 fans collapsed , injuring 96 . Miraculously , no one was killed . The concert was abandoned .  Led Zeppelin filled it for several nights in 1975 , charging # 1 a ticket : # 9 in today 's money , and what fans might pay for a programme these days .  The Rolling Stones , too , played Earls Court to packed houses , sometimes with Mick Jagger 's friend Princess Margaret and friends slipping into their seats just as the lights went down .  David Bowie also filled it . Earls Court was also where Spice Girl Geri Halliwell wore her famous Union flag dress at The Brit awards , and where , just the other week , the Victoria 's Secret fashion show extravaganza attracted huge attention .  And , finally , it was in an almost surreal atmosphere that the Bombay Bicycle Club , an Indie rock band from north London , took to the stage on Saturday . For this , it seems , was the very last gig of any kind at Earls Court .  Pink Floyd 's David Gilmour made a point of being there . He slipped on stage to sing the band 's song Wish You Were Here .  With rock royalty on stage , someone described the farewell to Earls Court as ` joyous ' .  Nostalgic would surely have been a better word to describe the night the music died .   \n",

            "By Rosie Taylor  PUBLISHED :  13:00 EST , 2 May 2013   |  UPDATED :  13:20 EST , 2 May 2013  The head teacher of a rival school allegedly injected the yoghurt with rat poison and left it on the road to the girls ' school  Two schoolgirls have died in China after eating yoghurt poisoned by the head of a rival kindergarten , according to state media reports .  The Xinhua News Agency said the girls ' grandmother found the yoghurt , which was left in a bag with a pile of notebooks , on the road near their school in Pingshan county .  She took the books and yoghurt back home and let the girls , aged five and six , have it when they came back from school .  But as they played outside after drinking it they suddenly started foaming at the mouth and collapsed to the ground .  The children were rushed to the local hospital where they began fitting , but they later died .  It is believed the girls were sisters named Lu and Flowers .  Chinese media reported six-year-old Lu died on the way to hospital , while her younger sister Flowers died a week later .  Hebei Youth Daily said their grandmother , who it named as Renshu Ting , also tasted some of the yoghurt and spent a few days in hospital .  Police said the yoghurt was poisoned with tetramine - a rat posion .  Officers believe poisoning was motivated by competition for students between the schools , media reports said .  Reports claimed the woman headteacher confessed to injecting rat poison into the yoghurt and asking a man to place it with notebooks on the road to the rival kindergarten , which is in Hebei province .  She and the man who allegedly helped her put the yoghurt on the road were arrested after the incident on April 24 .  There was no response from police or Pingshan county 's information office last night .  Five years ago , thousands of Chinese children were poisoned when the industrial chemical melamine was added to baby milk powder to make it appear to contain more protein .  Six children died and tens of thousands were made ill by the incident .  Death sentences were handed down to people found responsible for adding the melamine to the milk .  Hebei Province is a rural area in northern China near the edge of Inner Mongolia \n",

            "By Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter  Crews are battling to clean up a major U.S. shipping channel in Texas after a barge carrying almost one million gallons of thick , sticky oil collided with a ship in Galveston Bay near Houston , threatening an important shorebird habitat .  No timetable has been set to reopen the waterway after nearly 170,000 gallons of tar-like oil spilled on Saturday , creating a huge oil slick . But on Monday , more help was being called in to contain the spill and protect wildlife .  A barge carrying about 900,000 gallons of the heavy oil collided with a ship in the busy Houston Ship Channel , spilling as much as a fifth of its cargo into one of the world 's busiest waterways for moving petrochemicals , according to the Coast Guard .  Oil had been detected 12 miles offshore in the Gulf of Mexico by Sunday , and as many as 60 vessels were either waiting to get in or out . The Coast Guard - which called it a ` significant spill ' - said it expected to deploy more containment booms on Monday , with 24 vessels working to skim the oil .  Scroll down for video  Clean up efforts : Vessels work to skim oil off the surface of the water after 168,000 gallons of oil spilled into Galveston Bay , Texas on Saturday  Damage : United States Coast Guardsmen inspect oil washing ashore along Boddeker Road in Galveston as clean up efforts get underway  The cleanup effort comes exactly 25 years after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker slammed into the Bligh Reef in Alaska and spilled more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound . Two decades on and the coast remains polluted by the oil .  Environmental groups said the Texas spill occurred at an especially sensitive time . The channel in Texas City , about 45 miles southeast of Houston , has important shorebird habitat on both sides , and tens of thousands of wintering birds are still in the area .  ` The timing really could n't be much worse since we 're approaching the peak shorebird migration season , ' said Richard Gibbons , conservation director of the Houston Audubon Society .  He noted that just to the east is the Bolivar Flats Shorebird Sanctuary , which attracts 50,000 to 70,000 shorebirds to shallow mud flats that are perfect foraging habitat .  Fewer than 10 oiled birds had been found and recovered for transfer to a wildlife rehabilitation center as of Sunday afternoon , according to the Coast Guard . The Texas General Land Office has also deployed a bird rehabilitation trailer in the area for quick response .  ` This is a significant spill , ' Capt. Brian Penoyer , commander of the Coast Guard at Houston-Galveston , said . But he said the emptying the remaining oil from the barge on Sunday , a process known as lightering as contents are transferred to other vessels , was an important step and eliminated the risk of additional oil spilling .  Victim : A dead oil-covered bird is shown on the Eastern end of Galveston as environmental groups fear the effect on wildlife  Fears : A seagull lands in heavy crude oil washing up on East Beach . The spill occurred near an important shorebird habitat , environmental groups said  Covered : Almost 170,000 gallons of thick , sticky oil were spilled on Saturday . Pictured , the oil covers the shoreline in Galveston  Mess : People photograph oil washing ashore in Galveston on Sunday as crews place a protective boom along the shoreline  More than 380 people - ` and we 've ordered more , ' Penoyer said - along with a fleet of oil-retrieving skimmers and other vessels were deploying some 60,000 feet of containment booms around environmentally sensitive areas worked to mitigate the damage .  Some black tar-like globs , along with a dark line of a sticky , oily substance , could be detected along the shoreline of the Texas City dike , a 5-mile-long jetty that juts into Galveston Bay across from a tip of Galveston Island .  ` That is the consistency of what the cargo looks like , ' Jim Guidry , executive vice president of Houston-based Kirby Inland Marine Corp. , said when the substance was described to him at a news conference .  Guidry said the company - the nation 's largest inland barge company and owner of the barge that spilled the oil - was taking responsibility for the costs .  ` We 're very concerned . We 're focused on cleaning up , ' he said .  The barge has been moved to a shipyard and is no longer at the scene of the spill , according to a statement Sunday evening from Texas Gov. Rick Perry 's office .  Two cruise ships were allowed to travel through the incident area `` to minimize inconvenience to the thousands of passengers aboard and limit economic impacts from the spill , '' according to a statement Sunday evening from the Coast Guard .  Queue : The Royal Caribbean Navigator of the Seas and the Carnival Magic sit idle with dozens of other ships off the coast of Galveston . At least 33 vessels , including two cruise ships , are waiting to enter the Houston Ship Channel from the Gulf of Mexico  Race against time : Oil containment booms cut across a sand bar covered with birds on Pelican Island . So far about 10 birds have been killed  Fight : Crews place a protective boom along the seashore near Port Bolivar in Port Bolivar as dozens of ships help in the clean up effort on Sunday  Struggle : Workers try to move an oil containment boom from the shore area on the Eastern end of Galveston near the ship channel  Close to shore : Oil containment booms are spread out in Galveston Harbor after the collision spilled nearly 170,000 gallons of thick oil  The channel , part of the Port of Houston , typically handles as many as 80 vessels daily . But it will remain closed for a third day Monday , and the Coast Guard said there was no timetable on when it may reopen .  If the bottleneck of vessels in the Gulf eases in a day or so , there likely would n't be much impact on fuel prices . But a more prolonged backup could push up prices briefly , said Jim Ritterbusch , president of energy consultancy Jim Ritterbusch and Associates in Chicago .  The contents of the torn tank , equal to about 4,000 barrels , were lost or displaced into other vacant areas of the barge . Penoyer said currents , tides and wind were scattering the spill .  ` Containment was never a possibility in this case , ' he said .  The Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board are still investigating what happened .  ` It will take quite a bit of time , given the complexity of the vessels and a very busy waterway , ' Penoyer said .  Destruction : Marine fuel oil can be seen leaking from a partly submerged barge into the Houston Ship Channel after colliding with a ship on Saturday  Slick : A vessel surrounded by a sheen on the water near the Port of Galveston . The company of the barge carrying the oil is paying for clean up costs  Disaster : The spill comes on the 25th anniversary of the Exxon Valdez spill . In this April 17 , 1989 photo , a worker makes his way across the polluted shore of Block Island , Alaska after more than 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled  Heartbreaking : In this April 9 , 1989 photo , a local fisherman inspects a dead California gray whale following the spill in Alaska  Also closed was the Texas City dike , a popular fishing spot that goes out into the Gulf for a few miles .  Lee Rilat , 58 , owns Lee 's Bait and Tackle , the last store before the access road to the dike , which was blocked by a police car on a breezy , overcast Sunday . If it were n't for the spill , Rilat 's business would be hopping .  ` This would be the first spring deal , the first real weekend for fishing , ' he said .  The spill site is 700 yards offshore from the Texas City dike . A crane and several small boats could be seen at the cleanup site , and dozens of trucks were at a staging area along the beach .  The captain of the 585-foot ship , Summer Wind , reported the spill on Saturday afternoon . Six crew members from the tow vessel , which was going from Texas City to Port Bolivar , Texas , were injured , the Coast Guard said . \n",

At least three people were killed in separate afternoon accidents on the Ohio Turnpike and Interstate 71 , while a wave of heavy snow limited visibility at the Columbus airport and forced all flights to be grounded for a few hours .  A pregnant woman died in a multivehicle pileup that closed the westbound lanes of the Ohio Turnpike just east of Sandusky , authorities said .

            "A somber Pope Francis steeped his Christmas message to the world in sadness for those with little cause for joy -- abused children , refugees , hostages and others suffering from violence in the Middle East , Africa , Ukraine and elsewhere .  ` Truly there are so many tears this Christmas , said Francis , looking solemn and smiling little , to a crowd , estimated by the Vatican to number more than 80,000 Romans , tourists and pilgrims , filled St. Peter 's Square for his ` Urbi et Orbi ' message -LRB- Latin for ` to the city and to the world ' -RRB- .

Scroll down for video  Pope Francis waves as he delivers his ` Urbi et Orbi ' -LRB- to the city and world -RRB- message from the balcony overlooking St. Peter 's Square at the Vatican on Christmas Day  A sombre Pope Francis steeped his Christmas message in sadness for those with little cause for joy -- abused children , refugees , hostages and others suffering from violence in the Middle East , Africa , Ukraine and elsewhere  Anguish for children who suffer maltreatment or violence , including in the recent terrorist attack on a Pakistani military school , tempered the pontiff 's traditional Christmas Day speech  ' I think also of those infants massacred in bomb attacks , also those where the Son of God was born , ' he said , referring to the Middle East  Pope Francis condemned ` brutal ' religious persecution in the Middle East while urging peace in Nigeria , Ukraine and other troubled spots  He lamented that many children are ` made objects of trade and trafficking ' or forced to become soldiers , as well as those never born because of abortion .  ' I think also of those infants massacred in bomb attacks , also those where the Son of God was born , ' he said , referring to the Middle East .  The Pope also decried the persecution of ancient Christian communities in Iraq and Syria , along with those from other ethnic and religious groups .  ` May Christmas bring them hope , ' he said .  Referring to refugees and exiles , he prayed : ` May indifference be changed into closeness , and rejection into hospitality . ' He expressed hope they 'd receive humanitarian help to withstand the ` rigors of winter , return to their countries and live with dignity . '  The pope also thanked those courageously helping people infected with Ebola in Africa .  In his litany of the world 's troubled places , he denounced hostage-taking in Nigeria , and hoped that reconciliation would prevail over ` hatred and violence ' in Ukraine , where pro-Russian rebels have been fighting against government forces in the east of that country .  While much of his message concerned poor countries , Francis had harsh words for some in affluent nations . He prayed for an end to the hardened hearts ` of so many men and women immersed in worldliness and indifference , the globalization of indifference . '  ` Truly there are so many tears this Christmas , ' said Francis , looking solemn and smiling little , in contrast to his often jocular demeanor when addressing crowds  He lamented that many children are ` made objects of trade and trafficking ' or forced to become soldiers , as well as those never born because of abortion  A crowd , estimated by the Vatican to number more than 80,000 Romans , tourists and pilgrims , filled St. Peter 's Square to hear the speech  ' I think also of those infants massacred in bomb attacks , also those where the Son of God was born , ' he said , referring to the Middle East  Christmas joy will only be realized when weapons are transformed ` into ploughshares , destruction into creativity , hatred into love and tenderness , ' Francis concluded before giving the crowd his blessing .  Pope Francis celebrated Christmas Eve with a late-night Mass in St Peter 's Basilica after making a phone call to refugees in Iraq who have been forced to flee their homes by ISIS .  In the phone call , the Pontiff told refugees at the tent camp in Ankawa , northern Iraq , that they too were like Jesus and were forced to flee because there was no place for them .  His call of Christmas greetings came as the Vatican prepared to host the Mass , with the Pope already unveiling a statue of the baby Jesus in a nativity scene .  Referring to refugees and exiles , he prayed : ` May indifference be changed into closeness , and rejection into hospitality . ' He expressed hope they 'd receive humanitarian help to withstand the ` rigors of winter , return to their countries and live with dignity '  A boy listens to Pope Francis delivering his ` Urbi et Orbi ' -LRB- to the City and to the World -RRB- message in St. Peter 's Square at the Vatican today  Pope Francis focussed this year on the peace in the world and thanked those courageously helping people infected with Ebola in Africa  The faithful gather at St. Peter 's Square for the ` Urbi et Orbi ' blessing , recognised as a Christmas tradition by Catholics  Pope Francis swings incense around the statue of the baby Jesus after it was unveiled in St Peter 's Basilica earlier this evening  The Pontiff then bent down to kiss the figure of Jesus in the nativity scene as he prepared for the traditional Mass in the Vatican  Before the ceremony , the Pope called Iraqi refugees forced out of their homes by Muslim militants to pass on his Christmas greetings  The Pope carries the statue of the baby Jesus during the Mass , where he said Christmas is a time to remember God 's message of peace  Earlier this week , the Pope had written a Christmas letter to the Christians of the Middle East expressing his closeness to them  The Pope told the refugees : ` You 're like Jesus on this night , and I bless you and am close to you .  ' I embrace you all and wish for you a holy Christmas . '  The Ankawa camp houses mostly Christian refugees forced to flee the onslaught by militants of ISIS .  In a letter to Middle East Christians penned earlier this week , Francis urged them to remain in the region , where Christian communities have existed for 2,000 years , and to help their fellow Muslim citizens present ' a more authentic image of Islam ' as a religion of peace .  Pope Francis has written a Christmas letter to Christians in the Middle East to express his closeness to them at a time of ` afflictions and tribulations '  Pope Francis holds a cross in the late night service in St Peter 's Basilica , which marks the start of a busy festive period for the 78-year-old  The Mass came just days after Francis excoriated the Vatican bureaucracy for a laundry list of sins , including lusting for power and suffering from ` spiritual Alzheimer 's '  During the Mass hours later in St Peter 's , Francis echoed some of the themes he raised in the phone call as he reflected on the Nativity scene .  ` How much the world needs tenderness today ! ' he said . ` God 's patience , God 's closeness , God 's tenderness . '  In his homily , the Pope , wearing white vestments , said Christmas is a time to remember that God 's message of peace ` is stronger than darkness and corruption ' .  He said : ` The question put to us simply by the infant 's presence is , ` Do I allow God to love me ? ' Do we have the courage to welcome with tenderness the difficulties and problems of those who are near to us ? '  It is the second Christmas season for Pope Francis as leader of the Roman Catholic Church and being elected last year .  The Mass marked the start of a busy few weeks for the 78-year-old that includes New Year 's Eve vespers and 2015 greetings a few hours later .  On January 6 he will celebrate Epiphany Mass , and on January 11 he will baptise babies in the Sistine Chapel .  A day later he gives his annual foreign policy address to diplomats before boarding a plane for a week-long trip to Sri Lanka and the Philippines .  Today he focused his concern on those weeping in the world this Christmas , singling out refugees , hostages and others suffering in the Middle East , Africa and Ukraine as he prayed for hope and peace during his traditional Christmas Day message .  Anguish for children who are victims of violence , including in the recent terrorist attack on a Pakistani military school , tempered the pontiff 's speech , which he delivered from the central balcony of St. Peter 's Basilica .  Tens of thousands of Romans and tourists crowded into St. Peter 's Square to hear Francis deliver the ` Urbi et Orbi ' message - Latin for ` to the city and to the world ' .

Many of the same cardinals , bishops and priests who received the dressing down were on hand in St Peter 's Basilica for the Mass. .  Several have spoken out in recent days saying Francis was merely asking them to examine their consciences , as any Jesuit spiritual director would do , and to use the Christmas season to heal .  Meanwhile , thousands of pilgrims also flocked to Bethlehem to travel to the Church of the Nativity for traditional Christmas Eve celebrations .  On a crisp sunny day , revellers crowded into Manger Square , stopping in restaurants and admiring the Christmas tree in the town , where Jesus is believed to have been born .  Scout troops could be heard playing bagpipes , horns and drums , while street traders sold Santa hats and special sesame sweets for children .  The celebrations brought a boost to the area after a difficult year , which saw Israel battle Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip during a 50-day war over the summer .  The Church of the Nativity , built over the grotto that Christians believe is the site of Jesus ' birth , was flanked by a towering Christmas tree and a large poster in Arabic and English that read ` All I want for Christmas is justice .

A Met Office spokesman said today would see a cold and frosty start with sunny spells for most , but with outbreaks of sleet and snow across Northern Ireland edging eastwards , and across the northwest .  He said : ` Otherwise there 's a lot of dry weather today , cloudy and overcast , but brighter in parts of theeast .  ` Top temperatures today will be around 6C , apart from in Cornwall and Devon where they will be around 7 or 8 C.  ` Tonight maximum temperatures will be around 1 - 3 C but remain in single figures or zero . '  A Met Office spokesman said today would see a cold and frosty start with sunny spells for most , but with outbreaks of sleet and snow across Northern Ireland edging eastwards , and across the northwest  A car covered in snow in Oxenhope , West Yorkshire . Tonight is expected to be cold with outbreaks of rain , sleet and snow edging eastwards . Snow most likely across the north , but perhaps to parts of central and southern Britain later too  ` Tomorrow there will be outbreaks of rain , sleet and snow which will gradually fade away to sunny spells . However wintry showers remain possible across the southeast into the evening . It will stay cold , especially across central parts .  ` Thursday looks quite cloud , with light winds , and it will be dry throughout the day .  ` Friday will be much more unsettled , windier and with patchy rain . As we go into Saturday , we will see dry and bright weather , still fairly breezy , but temperatures will still be a lot milder than we have seen of late . '  Yesterday morning 's rush hour was beset by travel problems as roads were covered in ice and freezing fog after temperatures fell to at least -12.5 C in the Highlands overnight and forecasters have warned there will be no respite from the plummeting mercury until at least the weekend  Icy conditions on the A24 in West Sussex saw the road closed for more than an hour yesterday morning after a van overturned and seven vehicles slid off the carriageway .  Elsewhere , a car skidded off the A34 near Oxford , crashing through the central reservation and into a ditch . And ice was so thick in Gloucestershire that police were forced to close the main A46 Gloucester-Bath road in both directions .  In what police described as a ` serious accident ' a lorry jack-knifed near the Clacket Lane services on the M25 after colliding with a van .  The incident caused severe delays in both directions after the carriageway was left completely blocked between Surrey and Kent .  The hazardous conditions also closed several north east roads and shut down Aberdeenshire school transport yesterday .  Motorists have been urged to take care , with freezing temperatures and icy conditions in many areas .

The AA said workers had attended 10,000 breakdowns nationwide by 1pm yesterday with the busiest areas in Glasgow and Edinburgh .  RAC spokesman Simon Williams said : ` We are in red alert status and had attended 2,750 breakdowns by 11am - twice as many as we would do on a normal Monday morning . This means we will probably help around 10,000 motorists by the end of the day .  ` Our patrols are helping motorists with a range of cold weather-related problems including frozen locks and handbrakes as well as broken heaters that are unable to demist windscreens .  ` We are urging motorists to take extra caution on the roads and to make sure they always travel prepared .

            "From smartbands to high-end pedometers , never before have there been so many gadgets that claim to monitor health and boost fitness .  But as technology gallops ahead , most come at a considerable financial cost .  Now researchers have found that smartphone apps that track an physical activity are in fact just as accurate as many fitness gadgets .  Scroll down for video  Researchers have found that smartphone apps that track an individual 's physical activity , are just as accurate as software in fitness gadgets . A stock image of the Flex is pictured  The study compared the performance of a five devices - including Nike 's Fuelband , the Jawbone UP24 and Fitbit Flex - against five apps .  They analysed their ability to count steps as these are often used to calculate other measures of physical activity , such as distance covered or calories .  A total of 14 participants walked on a treadmill for 500 and 1,500 steps , multiple times , while different technologies counted their footsteps , according to a new research letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association -LRB- Jama -RRB- .  ` In this study , we wanted to address one of the challenges with using wearable devices : they must be accurate , said University of Pennsylvania medical student and lead study author , Meredith Case .  ` After all , if a device is going to be effective at monitoring - and potentially changing - behaviour , individuals have to be able to trust the data . '  The study was based 10 devices and apps ' ability to count steps and popular wearables . Screenshots from the iPhone Moves app - one of those surveyed - are shown left and right . Step counts are often used to derive other measures of physical activity , such as distance or calories  In the study , a total of 14 participants walked on a treadmill for 500 and 1,500 steps , multiple times , while technology counted their footsteps to determine the accuracy of the apps and gadgets . A stock image of a women who was n't involved in the study , is pictured  Galaxy S4 Moves app  iPhone 5s Moves app  iPhone 5S Health Mate app  iPhone 5s Fitbit app  Nike Fuelband  Jawbone UP24  Fitbit Flex  Fitbit One  Fitbit Zip  Digi-Walker SW-200  ` We found that smartphone apps are just as accurate as wearable devices for tracking physical activity . '  The study is a follow-up to a recent Jama viewpoint suggesting that there 's little evidence that wearable devices alone can change behaviour and improve health for those that need it most .  In the experiment , each of the healthy adults wore a waistband with one pedometer and two accelerometers attached , as well as three wearables on their wrist and two smartphones in their pockets .  The iPhone ran three apps - Moves , Health Mate and Fitbit - while the Android ran one Moves app .  At the end of each trial , step counts from each device were recorded .  The 10 top-selling devices and fitness apps in the US that were tested , were : Galaxy S4 Moves app , iPhone 5s Moves app , iPhone 5S Health Mate app , iPhone 5s Fitbit app , as well as Nike 's Fuelband , the Jawbone UP24 , Fitbit Flex , Fitbit One Fitbit Zip and the Digi-Walker SW-200 .  The data from the smartphones were only slightly different than the observed step counts , with a range of minus 6.7 to 6.2 percent relative difference in mean step count .  The results suggest that the Fitbit One and Zip devices are the most accurate surveyed , while Nike 's Fuelband -LRB- pictured -RRB- , appears to have the largest margin for error in the 500 and 1,500 step trials . However , over all , smartphone apps performed as accurately as wearables  But the data from the wearable devices differed more , with a range of between minus 22.7 to minus 1.5 percent .  The results suggest that the Fitbit One and Zip devices are the most accurate surveyed , while Nike 's Fuelband , appears to have the largest margin for error in the 500 and 1,500 step trials .  Apps such as Moves for iPhone proved fairly accurate . The free app automatically tracks walking , running and cycling and shows a user 's day as a simple storyline . It counts steps and shows calories burned for each activity .  Professor Mitesh Patel , an attending physician at the Philadelphia VA Medical Centre , who also teaches at the university , said : ` Since step counts are such an important part of how these devices and apps measure physical activity , including calculating distance or calories burned , their accuracy is key .  ` Compared to the one to two percent of adults in the U.S. that own a wearable device , more than 65 percent of adults carry a smartphone .  Our findings suggest that smartphone apps could prove to be a more widely accessible and affordable way of tracking health behaviours . ' \n",

            "Astronomers have calculated the origin of a meteor that injured 1,000 people after breaking up over central Russia .  They used amateur video footage to plot the path of the space rock that burned up over the city of Chelyabinsk causing shockwaves that blew out windows .  The results suggest the meteor belongs to a well known family of space rocks known as the Apollo asteroids , and probably came from an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter .  Scroll down for video  The Chelyabinsk meteor -LRB- labelled ChM -RRB- appears to have been on elliptical orbit around the Sun before it collided with Earth . The orbits of Earth and Mars are shown , although the calculations included the rest of inner and outer planets .  Dozens of videos of the fireball were taken with camera phones , CCTV and car-dashboard cameras and put online , and the team found two in particular that helped then worked out exactly where it came from .  Using this amateur video footage , they were able to plot the meteor 's trajectory through Earth 's atmosphere and then reconstruct its orbit around the Sun .  ` Using evidence gathered by one camera at the Revolution Square in the city of Chelyabinsk and other videos recorded by witnesses in the close city of Korkino , we calculate the trajectory of the body in the atmosphere and use it to reconstruct the orbit in space of the meteoroid previous to the violent encounter with our planet , ' said Jorge Zuluaga and Ignacio Ferrin , from the University of Antioquia in Medellin .  Experts said the meteor that left a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk , in the Urals , weighed around 100,000 tonnes and measured 55 feet in diameter  ` We use it to classify the meteoroid among the near Earth asteroid families ﬁnding that the parent body belonged to the Apollo asteroids . '  Using the footage and the location of an impact into Lake Chebarkul , the team calculated the height , speed and position of the rock as it fell to Earth .  They estimate that it was travelling between 13km/s and 19km/s , brightening up above Korkin when it was between 32km and 47km high .  Early estimates of the meteor 's mass put it at ten tonnes ; US space agency Nasa later estimated it to be between 7,000 and 10,000 tonnes . Nasa estimates the size of the object was about 17m -LRB- 55ft -RRB- .  The reconstruction uses three vantage points : the Revolution Square at Chelyabinsk -LRB- C -RRB- , the Korkin metropolitan area -LRB- K -RRB- and Lake Chebarkul -LRB- L -RRB- . The brightening point -LRB- BP -RRB- and the fragmentation point -LRB- FP -RRB- are the points of the trajectory seen from Chelyabinsk and measured using the shadow cast by the poles at the Revolutionary Square .  ` In February 15 2013 a medium-sized meteoroid impacted the atmosphere in the region ofChelyabinsk , Russia , ' the team wrote .  ` After its entrance to the atmosphere and after travel by several hundred of kilometers the body exploded in a powerful event responsible for physical damages and injured people spread over a region enclosing several large cities .  ` We present in this letter the results of a preliminary reconstruction of the orbit of the Chelyabinsk meteoroid . '  Once they had discovered its trajectory , the researchers put their figures into astronomy software developed by the US Naval Observatory .  The results suggest the meteor belongs to a well known family of space rocks known as Apollo .  Of about 9,700 near-Earth asteroids discovered so far , about 5,200 are thought to be Apollos .  The Apollo asteroids are a class of asteroids with Earth-crossing orbits .  The first Apollo asteroid was discovered in 1918 by Max Wolf observing from Heidelberg , Germany  Friction : Burning from the friction with Earth 's thin air , the space rock exploded 14.5 miles above the Russian town of Chelyabinsk  Asteroids are divided into different groups such as Apollo , Aten , or Amor , based on the type of orbit they have .  Dr Stephen Lowry , from the University of Kent , said the team had done well to publish so quickly .  ` It certainly looks like it was a member of the Apollo class of asteroids , ' he told BBC News .  ` Its elliptical , low inclination orbit , indicates a solar system origin , most likely from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter .  ` Perhaps with more data , we can determine roughly where in the asteroid belt it come from .

            "By Hayley Peterson  PUBLISHED :  15:00 EST , 2 August 2013   |  UPDATED :  16:23 EST , 2 August 2013  A Tennessee newspaper editor has been fired after writing a headline critical of President Obama .  Drew Johnson 's editorial , titled , ` Take your jobs plan and shove it , Mr. President : Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough , ' was published in the Chattanooga Times Free Press earlier this week when Obama visited the city .  The timing of the column gave it a national audience it might not otherwise have had . As a result , it went viral online and Johnson , the editor of the Times Free Press editorial page , has since been let go .  Drew Johnson says he was fired from his job as an editor for the Chattanooga Times Free Press for writing an anti-Obama headline on an editorial  The newspaper said it fired Johnson for violating a policy requiring that last-minute changes to headlines be approved by upper management .  In a statement published to its website on Friday , the paper stated : ` On Monday night , Johnson changed the approved headline on his Tuesday editorial from , `` Keep your jobs plan to yourself , Mr. President : Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough already '' to `` Take your jobs plan and shove it , Mr. President : Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough . ''  ` However , he waited until his editor had left for the day before changing the headline , ' the statement continued . ` That is a violation of our clear editing practice , and our trust . He admitted the following day that he failed to follow the standard set for him . '  Johnson claims that the editing policy was implemented after his piece was published earlier this week .  He says the real reason he was fired was because of pressure on his bosses from Obama 's supporters .  ' -LSB- The editor -RSB- said that she was disappointed in the headline , that she thought it was crass and she 'd gotten a lot of complaints by Obama supporters , ' he said in an interview with Fox News . ` Today I come into work and am told that I 'm fired for violating that policy that was n't put in place until the day after I wrote the piece . '  The newspaper said it fired Johnson for ` placing a headline on an editorial outside of normal editing procedures '  Johnson said he feels ` confident ' that if the headline had referenced former President George W. Bush rather than Obama , that he would still have a job .  He also pointed out that his headline was not changed online for several hours after the editorial was published to the paper 's website .  ' I just became the first person in the history of newspapers to be fired for writing a paper 's most-read article , ' he tweeted .  The paper pushed back against Johnson 's claims that his editors bowed to political pressure .  ` Johnson 's firing was not about yielding to political pressure , ' the paper said in its statement published online , which was not attributed to a specific person . ` He was not fired for writing an editorial criticizing President Barack Obama . The body of the editorial was approved for publication ; only the headline was changed . '  In a clear dig at Johnson , the paper added : ` The only instance when the Times Free Press ever denied Johnson the freedom to present his views was last week when he referred to pornography as a `` miracle product '' and touted the benefits of pornography stating that if teenagers watched pornography it would result in lower rates of teenage pregnancy . '  This statement was published to the Chattanooga Times Free Press website on Friday :  Contrary to statements made by former Free Press editor Drew Johnson and national media reports , Johnson was told on multiple prior occasions not to make material changes to editorials or headlines once they were approved by the editor responsible for the page .  On Monday night , Johnson changed the approved headline on his Tuesday editorial from , `` Keep your jobs plan to yourself , Mr. President : Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough already '' to `` Take your jobs plan and shove it , Mr. President : Your policies have harmed Chattanooga enough . ''  However , he waited until his editor had left for the day before changing the headline . That is a violation of our clear editing practice , and our trust . He admitted the following day that he failed to follow the standard set for him .  The language he chose was vulgar and not appropriate for this newspaper . Even Johnson himself admitted that the headline was `` harsh and perhaps crass to a fault '' in an editorial he wrote for this Sunday , which will not run .  Johnson 's firing was not about yielding to political pressure . He was not fired for writing an editorial criticizing President Barack Obama . The body of the editorial was approved for publication ; only the headline was changed .  The newspaper has allowed Johnson to write his opinions freely and without censorship during the time he worked here -- even when he wrote about very controversial topics that many readers complained about . In the past year we have printed at least 46 editorials critical of Obama on the Free Press page .  In fact the only instance when the Times Free Press ever denied Johnson the freedom to present his views was last week when he referred to pornography as a `` miracle product '' and touted the benefits of pornography stating that if teenagers watched pornography it would result in lower rates of teenage pregnancy .  The Times Free Press values having two editorial pages to express both conservative and liberal views . We encourage differing viewpoints and dissent , we believe having competing views makes community stronger . We expect those debates to be respectful .

            "By Liz Hull  PUBLISHED :  04:55 EST , 9 August 2013   |  UPDATED :  19:08 EST , 9 August 2013  With the spectre of redundancy hanging over them , council workers were no doubt filled with trepidation when an email from their boss landed in their inbox .  But the civil servants were left aghast when environment chief Terry Dunn signed off his update on plans to slash jobs by chatting about his upcoming wedding , honeymoon and favourite punk rock bands .  Now Mr Dunn , director of Wigan Council 's environment department , is being compared to comic character David Brent for his insensitivity .  ` Inappropriate ' : Terry Dunn -LRB- left -RRB- , head of Wigan Council 's environment department , has been compared to David Brent -LRB- right -RRB- after telling staff about his holiday in an email about redundancies  He told workers they ` may or may not be directly impacted ' by the authority 's restructuring plans , adding : ` If you are involved I can fully appreciate the concerns you will have and just ask for your patience . '  But his e-mail then started to echo the character played by Ricky Gervais in The Office , when he gave miffed workers a run down of his social life . It said : ` On the home front ; off to a punk rock festival in Blackpool this Friday . The Damned , Stiff Little Fingers and the Buzzcocks are amongst the acts playing so those old enough may remember them . I am really looking forward to it as it forms a big part of my past . '  He then added : ` Wedding six weeks this Saturday followed by two weeks in Fuerteventura !! Ca n't wait . '  Mr Dunn 's chummy email , sent on Monday , was received less than enthusiastically by his 200 staff .  One said : ` The restructure affects everybody . Many job titles have changed and staff have to reapply for their own jobs , if they still have them . So not good times for Wigan employees . '  Message : The full email Terry Dunn sent to staff in Wigan Council 's environment department  Union boss Kevan Nelson , Unison 's north west secretary , agreed the email was ` inappropriate ' .  ` It is a bit David Brent , ' Mr Nelson said . ` He probably meant it well but has underestimated the impact of these changes on his staff .  ` I recognise there is a style of management where you do n't want to appear overly-autocratic , but talking about your plans when people 's livelihoods are in the balance is not a good idea . '  In one episode of the popular BBC comedy , Brent famously announced to staff they were being made redundant by saying he had ` good news and bad news ' . The apparent good news was that he himself was being promoted .  Mr Dunn , who joined Wigan Council straight from school in the early 80s , is responsible for waste , roads and recycling in Greater Manchester 's second-biggest council .  The authority , which needs to cut 200 jobs this year to save # 18.8 million , said the senior manager was responding to staff feedback which called for more ` personalised ' messages .  Festival : Mr Dunn told staff he was off to Blackpool to see punk bands including Stiff Little Fingers -LRB- pictured -RRB- and The Buzzcocks who had formed ' a big part of my past '  A spokesman said : ` Terry Dunn has been employed by Wigan Council since he was taken on as an apprentice and has worked at virtually every level of the organisation . He has known many of our staff for 20 years .  ` These are tough times in local government . We 're trying to communicate with employees as best we can while we go through difficult changes .  ` Terry meant no harm and is sorry if he 's caused offence on this occasion . He has an excellent record of handling staffing issues seriously and sensitively . '  One of Mr Dunn 's colleagues added : ` Terry is a decent bloke . He is not one of your typical town hall bureaucrats . He worked his way up after starting as an apprentice .  ` Probably he should have realised the tone was totally wrong , but he would n't have meant any offence . '  Mr Dunn 's gaffe came as it emerged the chief executive of another company told staff they had lost their jobs by saying an ` opportunity ' had arisen for them to start looking for new work .  Jason Goldberg , of internet firm Fab.com , informed workers the business would be losing 100 workers in its Berlin office to allow it to focus more on the US , according to London 's City A.M. newspaper .  In an email Mr Goldberg said : ` Directly after this meeting you will learn what category your job falls into and whether you will have the opportunity to start your new job search immediately .

            "By Chris Pleasance  The White House has denied rumors that President Obama was due to appear on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show , saying he considered it , but turned it down  The White House has denied rumors that President Obama was set to make a ` surprise ' appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show on Wednesday night .  The President has been taking part in a fundraising drive on the West Coast and was due to pass through Los Angeles , where the show is recorded , tomorrow evening .  Appearing on the light-hearted Kimmel show as two major world crises continue to worsen in both Gaza and Ukraine could have caused controversy for Obama .  Having already appeared on TV with the likes of David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon , Obama 's travel plans sparked speculation that he would feature for an hour slot on Kimmel 's show .  According to TMZ sources at the LAPD and ABC Network confirmed the rumors , saying that the President would film a special segment , a large part of which would be ` serious ' .  TV Guide shows that on Wednesday , Kimmel has a performance from Common scheduled , with no other guests listed .  But the White House and a representative for the show later denied the President would feature .  White House spokesman Josh Earnest told the LA Times : ` In advance of the trip , we 've been in touch with Kimmel 's folks about the president doing his show .  ` We elected not to do it this time , but hope we can arrange to do it in the near future . '  Obama has already been criticised for attending multiple fundraising events while on his visit to the West Coast , despite the escalating situation in both Gaza and Ukraine .  Obama flies to fundraisers fro Democratic candidates in Seattle and San Fransisco on Tuesday before arriving in Los Angeles on Wednesday .  There , he will attend local Democratic National Committee events scheduled for Wednesday night and Thursday and will also appear Thursday at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College .  Fans of the show took to Twitter to discuss the news and some mocked Obama , with user Jonah Goldberg saying ` Unforeseen fundraiser get in the way ? ' and Jeannie Bondie adding : ` So just fundraisers , then ? ' .  Having previously appeared on TV with the likes of David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon , Obama 's trip to LA sparked speculation he could be about to appear with Jimmy Kimmel -LRB- pictured -RRB- \n",

            "An alternative artist uses popcorn , nuts and grape stems to create incredible portraits .  Victor Nunes , 65 , from São Paulo makes creative pictures of faces , people and animals by combining pen and paper with household objects .  The artist takes inanimate , mundane objects like nuts , scissors , fabric , foam , and food - and then doodles his ideas around them to create mini-masterpieces .  Victor arranges popcorn on a page and creates ` Art Attack ' style pictures full of character  The 65-year-old from São Paulo , Brazil , who has worked as an advertiser and art director since 1971 , said : ` I 've always played with images of food and other objects .  In one picture he uses pieces of popcorn and kernel and imagines them as a multitude of animals including pigs , leopards , cows and dogs .  In another , he manages to make a half-eaten Digestive biscuit represent a bra , bike helmet , umbrella and bicycle .  ' I went in with my personal Facebook page in February 2013 and started posting these images as an expression of pure enjoyment , ' he says .  ` Every day I do something , for me , it is a kind of therapy .  ' I have no preference for materials - I regard everything as a challenge but I try simple and easy things to find like coffee , dish cloths , floor cloths and food .  ' I always seek more challenges to create art and use common things to create the unusual . '  The artist takes mundane objects like grapes and then doodles his ideas around them  Victor imagines a dancer , umbrella , bike helmet and a bug using half-eaten Digestive biscuits  The re-imagining of inanimate , mundane objects is an example of the psychological phenomenon pareidolia .  It causes people to see random images and perceive them as something significant . In this case , Victor manages to create numerous detailed pictures from plain objects .  Our inclination to give meaning to random objects is the reason why we associate a smiley face with a human , and why some of Nunes ' pieces of popcorn or biscuit resemble faces to us .  Other examples of the phenomenon include seeing the image of Jesus in burnt toast or animal figures in clouds in the sky .  Baby corn is used to represent horns , noses and beaks , as well as towers and hats  He uses the stems from grapes to portray a fish , people , a headdress and flowers  His scissor portraits are full of personality - he arranged the objects to look like a bike or eyes  Victor has always played with images of food and started posting pictures on his Facebook page a year ago  He has no preference for materials but likes to use simple objects  Nuts , seeds and pulses do n't go unnoticed - Victor uses most foods you 'll find in the kitchen cupboard  He arranged crunchy salty snacks in the forms of trucks , boats , swings and houses  The alternative artist makes incredible faces by combining pen and paper with random food and objects \n",

The incident reportedly saw Harriers player Lee Vaughan punched by a fan .  The latest football fracas comes just a week after a weekend of shame for the sport which saw violence mar Millwall 's FA Cup tie and the Newcastle versus Sunderland clash in the Premier League .  Lat weekend also saw a football fan arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after allegedly driving into a group of rival fans before Rochdale 's match with Port Vale .  Ugly scenes ensued when Harriers Anthony Malbon gave the homes side , who also needed to win to stand any chance of catching rivals Mansfield Town in the promotion race , the lead in the 51st minute .  Angry Hatters fans reportedly confronted players from both sides and defender Vaughan was allegedly punched in the incident as he went to the aid of a rival player who had been confronted by a fan .  A man in his 20s was arrested on the pitch by police on suspicion of assault .  Referee Michael Bull was forced to suspend the game and take the players off the pitch for safety reasons while stewards and police attempted to calm the situation .

Jessica Clark , 30 , was given the jail term three days after her partner and neighbour Aaron Stefanski , 29 , from Fort Wayne , was sentenced to 18 months home detention for driving drunk with his three young children and Clark 's daughter tied to the hood of his sedan .  Superior Judge Wendy Davis ordered Clark to serve two and half years in jail on the neglect of a dependent charge , but ordered two years suspended and to be served on probation .  The first six months of her probation will be served on home detention .  In happier times : Aaron Stefanski poses with his three young children , who he strapped to the hood of his car in May in a drunken stupor  Clark was on a suspended prison sentence when she was charged the Ford Wayne Gazette Reported .  Police stopped Stefanski and Clark in May after a liquor store clerk spotted the children strapped to the hood of Stefanski 's white sedan .  Stefanski had tied his sons , age 4 and 5 , and his daughter , age 6 , along with Clark 's 7-year-old daughter , to the outside of the car .  Stefanski told police he tied the kids down because he ` thought they would like it , ' after his arrest on May 7 for the shocking incident .  But a subdued and seemingly repentant Stefanski told a judge in Fort Wayne , Indiana on Friday he regretted his actions , adding , ' I let alcohol make the decision for me . '  According to police , Stefanski 's blood alcohol level at the time was 0.17 percent -- more than twice the legal limit .  The four children were strapped to the roof of this car which was stopped by police on its way from a liquor store in Fort Wayne , Indiana . Luckily none of the children were hurt  Stefanski , who pleaded guilty to four class D felonies in July , was sentenced to four years in prison on August 3 .  At the time of his arrest , Stefanski had a blood alcohol level of 0.17 percent -- more than twice the legal limit  But the judge overseeing his case suspended two and a half years of his sentence and ordered his remaining time to be served on probation .  His lawyer , David Zent , said the troubled dad is addressing his alcohol problem and taking parenting classes , which he will continue while on home detention .  Stefanski 's ex-wife , the mother of his three children , said she was ` livid and in shock ' over her ex-husband 's antics .  But before sentencing , she told the court despite her ex 's horrifying negligence , he had been an excellent father and she believed him to be repentant .  She asked that he be spared prison time , so he could continue to work .  Superior Judge Wendy Davis said she found the case ` incredibly aggravating ' and reminded Stefanski of his duty to protect his children .  He has been barred from seeing his three children since the incident . \n",

The company - worth more than $ 700 billion - will replace telecom giant AT&T on the list with the switch taking effect after trading closes on Wednesday , March 18 .  There are only 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones - a price-weighted average of the biggest stocks - but for a long time Apple was excluded from the pile because its stock price was too high and there was worry it would distort the balance .  Apple has finally been accepted to join America 's oldest and most prestigious stock index , the Dow Jones industrial average  However , following Apple 's big stock split last summer , this is no longer a problem .  The company increased the number of shares it had to reduce the unit price from around $ 645 to $ 91 .  Currently the price rests around $ 130 .  With Apple 's entry AT&T will leave the Dow Jones .  David Blitzer , managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices , said there was no need to have two big telecom companies in the equation .  Verizon , which has a bigger stock price and larger market value , is in the Dow too . It will step in to lead the sector .  With Apple 's entry AT&T will leave the Dow Jones with Verizon representing the telecoms sector instead  The last big shake-up of the 119-year old Dow came in September , 2013 when Goldman Sachs , Nike and Visa knocked out Alcoa , Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard .  With news of the upcoming changes , Apple 's stock rose $ 2.55 , or two per cent , to $ 128.99 in early trading on Friday .  AT&T sank 46 cents , or 1.4 per cent , to $ 33.54 .

            "By Rebecca Camber  Last updated at 1:32 PM on 23rd June 2011  A council caretaker trafficked girls as young as 14 into Britain to work as prostitutes after they had been put under a voodoo spell , a court heard yesterday .  Anthony Harrison , 32 , is alleged to have raped two girls in Britain after they had been subjected to an extraordinary African black magic ritual by a people-smuggling gang .  The terrifying ceremony was performed in Nigeria by a Juju priest to trap the girls into a life of sex slavery , it was said .  Anthony Harrison , 32 , is alleged to have raped two girls in Britain after they had been subjected to an extraordinary African black magic ritual by a people-smuggling gang .  Woolwich Crown Court heard one 16-year-old girl was taken to a shrine and stripped naked before being cut so the priest could collect her blood to be put in a coffin  During the ritual , a 16-year-old girl was taken to a shrine where she was stripped naked by two men and slashed dozens of times with a razor so the priest could collect her blood which was placed in a coffin , Woolwich Crown Court heard .  In a terrifying ordeal ` little short of torture ' , the girl 's body hair was shaved off , her arms were bound behind her back and she was forced to lie naked and covered in blood in another coffin , jurors were told .  The victim also allegedly had to eat the raw heart of a freshly slaughtered chicken as part of the spell by the priest , who told her that he had access to her soul and if she did not obey his commands he could visit her in her dreams and ` kill her from within ' .  In another ritual , a 14-year-old girl was made to swear an oath of loyalty to a Juju medicine man who took her to a river and told her to eat some white clay , having passed a rock from his mouth to hers .  The youngster was instructed to wash with black soap and also given a raw chicken 's heart to eat , it was said .  On trial : Harrison , 32 , is alleged to be a ` key player ' in a Nigerian people smuggling gang who used African black magic to terrify two young girls  The court heard that in Nigeria where Juju is a greatly feared magic or medicine , the ceremonies ` bind ' the victims to the priest and ensure they would be too frightened to go to police .  The girls were later flown to Britain in 2009 on false documents where Harrison is alleged to have raped them before trying to pass them on to traffickers in Spain and Greece to work in the sex industry .  Juju is a form of witchcraft thought to have originated in West Africa which centres on the belief that objects can be endowed with magical powers .  It is widespread in Nigeria , where such objects are made into charms believed to have the power to protect people or influence events .  Many of the practices of Juju are unknown as they are conducted in secret , but are generally characterised by elaborate rituals , often involving animals .  It is thought the word Juju means ` fetish ' in Hausa , a language of northern Nigeria .  Juju travelled to the Americas from west Africa with the influx of slaves , and still survives in some communities that retain strong ties with their traditions .  In more recent times , migrant workers from the region brought Juju to Britain and other parts of Europe .  Riel Karmy-Jones , prosecuting , said : ` Anthony Harrison is , we suggest , a key player in what is undoubtedly a sophisticated and organised criminal network of West African people traffickers who have been operating in the UK . '  Harrison , who led a double life as a caretaker for Newham Council in East London , allegedly had at least seven aliases . Police still do not know his real identity .  He arrived in Britain from Nigeria in April 2003 , falsely claiming to be a Liberian national . Although he was refused asylum and his appeals failed , he was later granted indefinite leave to remain .  The court heard that the girls hailed from very poor backgrounds in Edo , Nigeria . The 14-year-old victim had been abandoned as a baby and was raised as a ` domestic drudge ' in a single-roomed hut , before being sold into prostitution .  The elder girl was brought up by her uncle who sexually abused her .  Miss Karmy-Jones said : ` The two young women concerned were little more than children when they were trafficked into this country . ' They were allegedly ` groomed ' by their handlers and given ` scripts ' to tell UK immigration staff that they were claiming asylum , having been forced to flee their country because they were accused of being lesbians .  Under her handler 's instructions , the 16-year-old later absconded from a children 's home to meet up with Harrison , it was claimed .  Harrison is said to have threatened to kill her if she went to the police . He allegedly forced her to sleep outside , starved her and plied her with alcohol before raping her . He is also accused of raping and beating the 14-year-old .  Harrison , of Stratford , East London , denies counts of conspiracy to traffic people for sexual exploitation ; two counts of false imprisonment ; two counts of rape ; and four counts of conspiracy to facilitate breaches of immigration law .  The trial continues .   \n",

            "MacIntrye alleges Ford conspired with Payman Aboodowleh , who coached football with Ford , to have one of their former players , who was also in jail at the time , to hurt him  By Daily Mail Reporter  Just as you thought things could not get any worse for Rob Ford , Toronto 's crack-smoking mayor was ticketed Friday night for jaywalking and public intoxication in Vancouver .  Canada 's most notorious public official was in town for the funeral of a family friend when he was stopped by police for crossing the street on a red light .  Eyewitness Ian Currie told Global News that he overheard the mayor tell police officers : ' I f-ed up , boys ... I thought it was looser on the West Coast , I thoughts you were cooler over here . '  More trouble : Rob Ford , Toronto 's crack-smoking mayor , was ticketed Friday night for jaywalking and public intoxication in Vancouver  The News reported that the mayor was walking on North Road when he was flagged by an officer outside a Shell gas station .  According to the news site , Ford , who has been battling drug and alcohol addiction , may have ducked into a nearby pub called Foggy Dew earlier in the evening .  Ford 's latest run-in with police drew a sizable crowd in Vancouver , with the hapless public servant pleading with onlookers not to take pictures of him because he is ` going to get in a lot of trouble . '  The incident comes just days after the embattled mayor was named in a lawsuit filed by his sister 's ex-boyfriend for allegedly conspiring to have the man beaten in jail to prevent Ford 's illicit behaviors from becoming known .  A lawsuit submitted Wednesday by Scott MacIntyre alleges the mayor was behind an assault at a Toronto jail in March 2012 that was intended to keep MacIntrye quiet about Ford 's abuse of alcohol and drugs .  The lawsuit alleges MacIntrye was threatened with ` dire consequences ' if he did not remain quiet . He was in jail after being charged with threatening the mayor , for saying he would expose his ` unsavory activities , ' the lawsuit says .  Rob Ford , accused of planning an attack on his sister 's ex , has a history of drug use and tongue slips  Rob Ford may have some secrets he 'd do anything to keep quiet  MacIntrye alleges Ford conspired with Payman Aboodowleh , who coached football with Ford , to have one of their former players , who was also in jail at the time , to beat MacIntyre up .  Ford and Aboodowleh arranged for staff members at the Metro West Detention Centre to ` ensure ` there was no supervision or surveillance of the area ' where the alleged assault occurred , the lawsuit says .  Ford 's lawyer , Dennis Morris , said the allegations are ` without fact or foundation . '  When questioned further if the mayor had conspired in any way to harm MacIntyre , Morris said , ` The answer is no . '  Ford offered no comment when reporters asked him about the lawsuit .  The mayor acknowledged last year that he had smoked crack , but he has rebuffed pressure to resign .  The lawsuit also names Ontario 's Ministry of Correctional Services , which is responsible for the province 's jails , Aboodowleh and Aedan Petros , the former football player who MacIntyre alleges attacked him .  Mayor Rob Ford was at Toronto city council special meeting to consider the 2014 budget yesterday \n",

She was recently signed to Mega Modelling Agency and as her profile states , her height - she is 5ft 10 - and striking features have got her noticed among talent hawks despite her youth .  Now she says she has a ` mind of my own ' and is only allowed to pursue her dream of a modelling career ` because I am doing so well at school . '  After being allowed to open and close the show for Riani she told German newspaper Bild : ` This is an absolute dream which has come true for me . All my girlfriends dream about such a chance . Everything went incredibly quickly for me . '  Of course , she said she knows that it is a fact that her name opens doors , adding ; ` Yes , but I can not make myself unknown . '  Boris acknowledged Anna was his child in February 2001 and obtained joint custody of his daughter in November 2007 -LRB- pictured together when Anna was younger -RRB-  Proud father Boris posted this Tweet to his 586,000 followers with a link to a picture of Anna on the catwalk  Boris captioned the picture of his daughter ` What a beautiful young lady #Anna #family #Berlin #mbfw '  Boris went on Twitter shortly after her debut to express his pride in her and Anna admitted that her mother , 47 , whom she lives with in London , is equally proud of her and accompanied her to Berlin from the home they share in London .  Though she has inherited her father 's ginger hair and his distinctive features , it seems she has followed in her mother 's footsteps when it comes to her career .  She starred in German label Riani 's autumn/winter 2015 show on Tuesday , modelling a series of dresses for the brand before walking the catwalk with Riani designers Ulrich Schulte and Isi Degel .  Anna went on : ` It is n't it about the money . I also do not consider myself as a professional . It 's a small beginning of something that I want to try . '  Ted Linow , her agent at Mega Models , refused to discuss her earnings saying : ` No models talk about that . '  Asked if 14 was a little early to start work , she said : ` My mother is , naturally , always with me and I want it that way . That 's what I 'm doing here , an excursion into a new world , which I really love . I really never expected to cause such a frenzy . '  While 14-year-old Anna looked stunning in a silver dress , the giant poodle was not explained  Anna paused to ` pet ' the poodle at the end of the runway before allowing it to walk on ahead of her  In another interview with German glossy magazine Gala , Anna insisted : ' I am not a child any more and I believe modelling is the key to bringing me further along in life , perhaps even as a full-time career .  I think people probably have other things to interest them other than my name - I 'm seeking to simply be myself . '  Boris , a five-time Wimbledon winner and currently the coach of world number one Novak Djokovic , had initially denied that Anna was his daughter .  But after a DNA test in DNA test in February 2001 proved he was the father , he agreed to support Anna and obtained joint custody in November 2007  The ` five second ' romp not only produced a daughter , but cost Becker his marriage to Barbara , with whom he has two sons . The divorce settlement came in at # 20million .  The German star has previously spoken of his ` guilt and shame ' over the quickie which happened just after he announced his retirement .  Despite the high price he paid for the brief encounter , he claims he now loves the daughter who he initially doubted was his .  He said : ' I live and learn . It cost my marriage , it cost for the next couple of years my private life but having Anna is not a mistake any more . I have a beautiful daughter . I love her very much . '  Despite the publicity and scandal surrounding her conception , Anna has managed to remain largely out of the spotlight during her childhood .  Despite this being her first ever appearance on the catwalk , Anna seemed very confident  After the slightly bizarre walk with the white poodle , Anna hit the runway again for Riani in a more conservative fashion in a navy flapper style dress -LRB- right -RRB-  Anna as a baby with her mother , German model Angela Ermakova -LRB- left -RRB- is the result of a liaison on a stairwell with the five-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker -LRB- right -RRB-  Boris has two sons , Noah , left , and Elias , right , with his first wife Barbara  According to Anna , she likes playing soccer in her spare time and is a visitor to a private London gym . And the report said that in her life her mother is an ` omnipresent ' figure .  But Anna insists : ` My mother neither dominates nor manipulates me . I have my own mind . Nevertheless , I want my mother to be more of a girlfriend . '  Angela said that as Anna grows she realises she will have to step back from her life , adding : ` Every small ship must sometime sail off alone in the open sea . '  Boris pictured with wife Sharlely Lilly Kerssenberg  Born in 1967 in Leimen , West Germany , Boris became a professional tennis playing in 1984 at the age of 17 .  He caused a storm in the sport when , as an unseeded adolescent he became the youngest player to ever win the Wimbledon men 's final .  In the course of his career he won a total of 49 singles and 15 doubles titles including three wins at Wimbledon , reaching the iconic final seven times in 10 years .  Becker married his first wife Barbara Feltus in Decemeber 1993 and the couple went on to have two sons together ; Noah , born on January 18 , 1994 , and Elias , born on September 4 , 1999 .  However in the summer of 1999 , having just retired from tennis , Boris had his now much publicised trist with model Angela Ermakova at Nobu in London .  When his wife Barbara found out about the one night stand - which occured while she was pregnant with their second child - she moved to Florida and filed for divorce . She fought their pre-nuptual agreement and managed to win # 14,400,000 and the custody of both sons in divorce court .  Boris has since said during the argument in which he confessed his infidelity , Barbara struck him .  The one night stand also resulted in Angela becoming pregnant .  Although Boris disputed paternity for months - even suggesting in a German paper that Angela , working for the Russia government - had stolen his sperm and impregnated herself .  His daughter Anna was born on 22 March 2000  A DNA test in February 2001 proved Boris was the father and he agreed to support Anna and obtained joint custody in November 2007 .  During this period Boris also had a firey on-again-off-again relationship with German rap singer Sabrina Setlur , as well as breifly becoming engaged to to Alessandra Meyer-Wölden  Moving to Switzerland and enjoying a few years less in the media spotlight , Becker remarried in 12 June 2009 in St Moritz , Switzerland to Dutch model Sharlely Lilly Kerssenberg  The couple have a three-year-old son named Amadeus Benedict Edley Luis Becker .   \n",

            "By Ellie Zolfagharifard  The International Space Station -LRB- ISS -RRB- was forced to dodge a deadly field of space junk last week after debris came within 1,000 feet -LRB- 0.3 km -RRB- of its orbit .  On Thursday , the Expedition 39 astronauts raised the altitude of the ISS by half a mile -LRB- 0.8 km -RRB- to prevent a Gravity-style disaster .  Nasa said the astronauts fired 53 thrusters at on the ISS ' Zvezda Service Module for three minutes , 40 seconds to complete the manoeuvre .  The International Space Station -LRB- ISS -RRB- was forced to dodge a deadly field of space junk last week after debris came within 1,000 feet -LRB- 0.3 km -RRB- of its orbit  This was enough to prevent the space station from colliding with parts of an old Ariane 5 rocket which was launched by the European Space Station .  This is the second time in less than three weeks that the ISS has had to sidestep space junk .  Nasa spokesman Kelly Humphries said the space agency has had to consider sidestepping space junk dozens of times since the outpost was launched in 1998 , sometimes cancelling the orbital dodge at the last moment .  On Thursday , the Expedition 39 astronauts raised the altitude of the ISS by half a mile -LRB- 0.8 km -RRB- to prevent a Gravity-style disaster . In the film In ` Gravity ' two astronauts are left drifting in the void after a collision between satellite debris and their spacecraft  Since the first object , Sputnik One , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris .  The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel .  There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites .  It is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth 's orbit , travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph .  One major source of debris in the past was the testing of anti-satellite weapons carried out by both the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s .  Accidental events have also contributed to the problem . In February 2007 for instance , a Russian Briz-M booster stage exploded in orbit over South Australia .  More recently , the GOCE satellite , also known as the ` Ferrari of space ' , made a fiery fall to Earth in November last year .  The station also moved on March 16 this year to avoid an old Russian weather satellite part .  And the problem is only set to get work . Last year , Nasa said the amount of space junk orbiting Earth has reached a tipping point .  This junk -- which can include anything from old rockets , abandoned satellites to missile shrapnel - will soon make it difficult for spacecraft to leave the planet , the space agency claims .  There are currently around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites .  Overall , it is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth 's orbit , travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph .  As well as this , there are many millions of pieces of debris that are so small they ca n't be tracked .  Even tiny paint flecks can damage a spacecraft when travelling at these velocities .  A number of space shuttle windows have had to be replaced because of damage caused by material that was analysed and shown to be paint flecks .  ` The greatest risk to space missions comes from non-trackable debris , ' said Nicholas Johnson , Nasa chief scientist for orbital debris .  Since the space age began 54 years ago , civilisation has littered the area just above Earth 's atmosphere with leftover boosters and other parts that come off during launches , as well as old satellites .  Many pieces of space junk fall back down to Earth , but most burn up on re-entry .  It is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth 's orbit , travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph  One major source of debris in the past was the testing of anti-satellite weapons carried out by both the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s .  Accidental events have also contributed to the problem . In February 2007 for instance , a Russian Briz-M booster stage exploded in orbit over South Australia .  The booster had been carrying an Arabsat-4A communication satellite but malfunctioned before it could use all of its propellant creating a cloud of space debris .  Based on a data archive , each miniature sphere in this image represents an existing object orbiting in space . There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track  More recently , the GOCE satellite , also known as the ` Ferrari of space ' , made a fiery fall to Earth in November last year .  Its debris fell along a path through East Asia and the Western Pacific to Antarctica but no one was hurt .  Several solutions to retrieving or moving the space junk have been put forward including giant cosmic versions of harpoons , nets , tethers , magnets and even a giant dish or umbrella-shaped device .  Mission Control also has the option of taking additional precautions , such as closing hatches between some of the station 's modules , if the likelihood of a collision is great enough .  The debris field was created by parts of an old Ariane 5 rocket launched by European Space Agency \n",

            "Announcement : Anton Krasovsky , 37 , was sacked from his job for admitting he was gay on live television  A Russian television presenter was sacked after coming out on live television .  Anton Krasovsky , 37 , made the announcement on the KontrTV network , a Kremlin-backed Internet and cable television network he helped to launch .  ` I 'm gay , and I 'm just the same person as you , my dear audience , as President Putin , as Prime Minister Medvedev and the deputies of our Duma , ' Mr Krasovsky said .  He told CNN in a recent interview that he was sacked the same night that he made the announcement at the end of the Friday night show .  It appeared that videos of his announcement in earlier this year were deleted from the Kontr TV website and YouTube .  He told the interviewer he was not sure who was behind the decision to delete the footage .  Mr Krasovsky , who was an editor-in-chief at the channel later told The Independent : ' I have made a lot of money in television and I understood that I 'd lose everything , ' he recalls over coffee , months later . He is currently unemployed . ` But I also understood that I could n't do anything else . I did n't do it so that I would get hundreds of likes on my Facebook page . I did it because I wanted them to hear it in the Kremlin . And they heard it , and were surprised . '  The issue of homosexuality in Russia is under intense scrutiny at the moment - yesterday FIFA has asked authorities in 2018 World Cup host Russia for ` clarification and more details ' about a new anti-gay law , joining the International Olympic Committee in seeking answers from Moscow.Legislation prohibiting ` propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations among minors ' has provoked an international furor since President Vladimir Putin signed it off in June and sparked growing concern at the IOC ahead of the Sochi Winter Games next February .  Decision : He made the announcement on the KontrTV network , a Kremlin-backed Internet and cable television network he helped to launch  Sacked : He told CNN in a recent interview that he was sacked the same night that he made the announcement at the end of the Friday night show  Russian lawmakers say the law does n't outlaw homosexuality but merely discourages discussion of it among people younger than 18 .  ` I 'm gay , and I 'm just the same person as you , my dear audience , as President Putin , ' Mr Krasovsky said  However , the law has outraged Russian liberals and some sectors of the international community just six months before the start of the Winter Olympic Games in the Russian city of Sochi .  The law does not outlaw gay sex , which was legalized in Russia in 1993 .  It does not explicitly ban participation in gay pride parades or promotion of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender equality online , but anyone wearing a rainbow flag on the street or writing about gay relationships on Facebook , for instance , could be accused of propagandizing .  No one has yet gone to court under the federal law . Six LGBT activists were detained after one of them unfurled a banner reading ` Being gay is normal ' near a children 's library in Moscow , but so far the participants have not been brought to trial .  Four Dutch citizens working on a documentary film about gay rights in the northern Russian town of Murmansk were the first foreigners to be detained under the new law .  They were fined and forced to leave the country , but were n't put on trial .  There have been six cases in which individuals have been tried for ` propaganda ' under regional legislation .  While the legislation outraged Russian liberals and activists , a poll by the independent Levada Center in Russia found that 73 percent of respondents supported any government efforts to curb homosexual propaganda .  Four out of five Russians say that they do not have a single LGBT acquaintance . \n",

            "By Sam Webb  PUBLISHED :  12:12 EST , 12 December 2012   |  UPDATED :  12:26 EST , 12 December 2012  An artist has created a colourful chandelier constructed almost entirely out of 8,500 hand-cast acrylic gummy bears .  Kevin Champeny spent months creating ` Candelier ' for home furnishings company Jellio and was behind the sweet-inspired furnishings in the bedroom of Carly Shay , the main character in Nickelodeon 's hit teen sitcom iCarly .  Mr Champeny creates large artworks that look like sculptures or mosaics , but a closer investigation reveals they are made of hundreds or thousands of tiny objects , often individually cast by the artist .  Light snack : A chandelier made from over 8500 gummiy bears has been created by artist Kevin Champeney  Tasty art : His sculpture take months to complete and straddle the line between sculpture and mosaic  Intricate : None of the gummy bears were painted and each batch had to be cast in the right colour  His artwork ` Flag is an American flag made up of 44,450 urethane army men cast in red , white , and blue , while ` What Remains ' is a five foot wide skull mosaic made up of more than 35,000 tiny flowers .  ' A Rose By Any Other Name ' is another candy-themed work and uses more than 15,000 acrylic pieces of candy and weighs 75lbs .  He starts by building silicone moulds of the original pieces , then casts them in colour , meaning nothing is painted , each hue has to be mixed and cast using various resins .  The final objects numbering in the tens of thousands are then painstaking glued to a surface piece by piece , meaning that the entire process for each artwork spans several months to design , sculpt and cast .  Good enough to eat ? : Those with a sweet tooth will be disappointed to learn the treats are cast in acrylic  Art : Other works by Mr Champeny include a human skull made from tiny flowers and a rose created using various types of sweets \n",

            "By Sarah Griffiths  We often think of emoticons arriving with the invention of text speak - when people first started to send messages using mobile phones and in emails .  But the first emoticon -- specifically the smiley face -- could have been used much earlier .  Literary critic Levi Stahl came across a poem written in 1648 which includes what could be the first possible use of the smiley face emoticon , or ' :-RRB- ' .  Emoticon or typo ? Literary critic Levi Stahl came across a poem written by English civil ar poet Robert Herrick in 1648 which includes what could be the first possible use of ' :-RRB- ' . The possible emoticon appears in the second line of his poem , ` To Fortune ' -LRB- pictured -RRB-  The questionable emoticon appears in the second line of English civil war poet Robert Herrick 's verse , entitled ` To Fortune ' .  The first couple of lines read : ` Tumble me down , and I will sitUpon my ruins , -LRB- smiling yet :-RRB- '  He wanted to know whether the mark was a typo in his poetry book ` Hesperides ' so he checked it against a two-volume version of Herrick 's poetry published by Oxford University Press last year . He found that the ` emoticon ' is included .  The literary critic explained Herrick 's poetry is rich in wit , so it 's possible that the smiley face was used deliberately . An illustration of the poet 's bust is pictured  Mr Stahl wrote on his blog : ` Herrick 's poetry is rich in wit , so it 's not entirely out of the bounds of possibility that this is something more than a punctuational oddity . '  If the mark is deliberately made to show a smile , it would predate another ` emoticon ' by some two hundred years .  That emotional piece of punctuation was found in a New York Times transcript of one of Abraham Lincoln 's speeches in 2009 , according to the newspaper 's City Room blog .  It reads : FELLOW CITIZENS : I believe there is no precedent for my appearing before you on this occasion , -LSB- applause -RSB- but it is also true that there is no precedent for your being here yourselves , -LRB- applause and laughter ;-RRB- and I offer , in justification of myself and of you , that , upon examination , I have found nothing in the Constitution against . -LSB- Renewed applause . -RSB-  However , writing in the New Atlantis , which describes itself as a ` journal of technology and society ' , Alan Jacobs says : ' I hate to be a party pooper -- no , really : I hate it -- but I just do n't think Levi Stahl has found an emoticon in a seventeenth-century poem -- nor , for that matter , that Jennifer 8 . Lee found one from 1862 . '  If the mark in the poem was deliberately made to show a smile -LRB- pictured -RRB- , it would predate another 'em oticon ' by some two hundred years , which was found in a New York Times transcript of one of Abraham Lincoln 's speeches in 2009  Emoticons such as smiley and sad faces are changing the way our brain works , Australian researchers have claimed .  They say the use of the punctuation faces trigger parts of the brain usually reserved for looking at real faces .  They believe this may be the key to their popularity - as we process them as a real face .  'Em oticons are a new form of language that we 're producing , ' Dr Owen Churches of the school of psychology at Flinders University in Adelaide told ABC News .  ` And to decode that language we 've produced a new pattern of brain activity . '  The researchers say that we pay more attention to faces than most other things we see as we try to ` read ' them for emotion .  The team wanted to see if this was the case with emoticons . They showed 20 participants images of real faces , smiley face emoticons and a meaningless string of characters .  They used electrophysiology to determine the pattern of electrical activity in the brain when the participants viewed the different images , and found we react to emoticons ion the same way .  ` There is no innate neural response to emoticons that babies are born with . Before 1982 there would be no reason that ' :--RRB- ' would activate face sensitive areas of the cortex but now it does because we 've learnt that this represents a face , '' said Dr Churches .  ` This is an entirely culturally-created neural response . It 's really quite amazing . '  He said : ` If we were really serious about finding out whether Robert Herrick had used an emoticon , we 'd look for his manuscripts - since we could never be sure that his printers had carried out his wishes accurately , especially in those days of highly variable printing practices . '  He looked up a 19th century version of the work and found that there was no ` emoticon ' . But as the original manuscripts are not available , the mark may remain a mystery .  However , despite literary spots , Scott Fahlman , of Carnegie Mellon University , Pittsburgh , wrote in a blog post : ` Yes , I am the inventor of the sideways ` smiley face ' -LRB- sometimes called an emoticon -RRB- that is commonly used in e-mail , chat , and newsgroup posts . Or at least I 'm one of the inventors . '  According to the professor , they came to be used in the early 1980s among the computer science department 's online bulletin boards where a mixture of serious and jokey messages were posted .  ` In at least one case , a humorous remark was interpreted by someone as a serious safety warning , ' he writes .  ` Some people suggested marking posts to show that they were not serious . Various ` joke markers ' were suggested and in the midst of that discussion it occurred to me that the character sequence :--RRB- would be an elegant solution , ' he said .  ` In the same post , I also suggested the use of :--LRB- to indicate that a message was meant to be taken seriously , though that symbol quickly evolved into a marker for displeasure , frustration , or anger . '  Professor Fahlman said that the convention caught on quickly around the university and soon spread to other institutions and research labs via primitive computer networks . \n",

            "By Leon Watson  PUBLISHED :  11:54 EST , 27 March 2013   |  UPDATED :  11:56 EST , 27 March 2013  A wealthy businessman has been beaten about the head with a hammer during a # 75,000 gems raid at his luxury home .  Haulage boss Mark Schofield , 57 , and his 58-year old partner Sue Evans were asleep in bed when three thugs wearing balaclavas burst into their bedroom at 4.30 am demanding cash and jewellery .  As Mr Schofield sat up in bed one of the gang hit him in the head with a hammer before they tore a Rolex watch from the wrist of Miss Evans .  Businessman Mark Schofield has was left injured and covered in blood after being hit over the head with a hammer when the family home was targeted by three masked robbers  Mr Schofield , director of MS Transport in Bolton , showed off his horrific injuries  They then stole his Rolex , a diamond ring and a Louis Vuitton handbag before fleeing in Mr Schofield 's 2006 Porsche Cayenne .  The couple said they had been left badly shaken up by the incident and are stepping up security at his isolated # 500,000 Georgian home in Turton , near Bolton , Greater Manchester .  The property is currently undergoing a refurbishment meaning that large parts were not covered by the property 's alarm system at the time of the raid on Tuesday .  Today , Mr Schofield , director of MS Transport in Bolton , showed off his horrific injuries and said : ` The incident was absolultely terrifying and I feared for my life .  ' I had absolutely no idea what these guys were capable of and I should be lucky I 'm still here in the land of the living given I was hit over the head with a hammer . '  He added : ' I am a light sleeper and I heard a bang at about 4am , which woke me up .  ' I was n't sure what was going on but thought no more about it . Then 15 minutes later , after dropping off to sleep again , I could hear footsteps and then all of a sudden the bedroom door burst open .  The balaclava-clad gang managed to steal two # 30,000 Rolex watches , a diamond ring , a Louis Vuitton handbag and the couple 's 2006 Porsche Cayenne  The couple said they had been left badly shaken up by the incident and are stepping up security at the isolated # 500,000 Georgian home  The thieves broke into the house on Greens Arms Road in the Turton area of Bolton , Greater Manchester while the family were asleep  ` It was pitch black and then there was this almighty roar . Before I could react three mean wearing balaclavas were at our bedside and all hell broke loose then .  ` They were screaming at the top of their voices . They were saying ` where 's your stuff ' and ` give us your stuff ' . One of them turned the light on and saw Sue was wearing a Rolex .  ` She tried to tell them that she would give them the watch but they were trying to tear it from her wrist . I sat up and tried to grab one of them and , with his left hand but he hit me across the head with the hammer and shouted ` where 's yours ' .  ` Blood went everywhere and the blow really knocked me back .  Mr Schofield , from Greater Manchester , said : ` The incident was absolutely terrifying '  ` It was very quick they took the watches and some other jewellery and then started shouting that they wanted our mobile phones .  ' I told them that the phones were downstairs so they ran downstairs and then left . I saw them driving off in my Porsche . '  The couple have lived together at the detached property in rural Greens Arms Road , Turton , near Bolton , Greater Manchester , for around 12 months .  About 30 officers attended the incident and crime scene investigators spent all day searching the area and CCTV from local properties is being reviewed .  Miss Evans said : ` It was awful , we were petrified . I could hear Mark 's head smash and there was blood everywhere . He could have been killed  ' I got out of bed and kept pressing the panic button to our alarm . One of the men put the hammer on my hand and he took the Rolex off my wrist . '  The gang dropped Mr Saunders ' wallet and a jewellery box on the driveway as they ran for the Porsche .  Lancashire Police said the burglars had arrived in a white Ford Fiesta which was later found dumped in nearby Chapeltown .  It is thought the gang arrived in the stolen car and crept through a nearby field to approach the house from the rear . They then broke in to the property through French doors .  Detective Sergeant Marc Saunders , said : ` This was a nasty and unprovoked attack on a couple while they were sleeping . They were lucky .  ` We believe the Ford Fiesta had been stolen about 7pm the night before the burglary . We believe the vehicle had been abandoned by the thieves who left the scene in the Porsche Cayenne . '  ' I appeal for anyone who saw anything suspicious in Turton in the days leading up to the burglary to come forward . ' \n",

            "Brendan Rodgers felt the Chelsea game would be the biggest of Liverpool 's week . After an extraordinary night in Madrid on Tuesday , it has now become bigger than even he could have imagined .  I was in Madrid as a fan . These occasions sum up what Liverpool are about : the Champions League , a capacity crowd in a magnificent stadium , supporters travelling in vast numbers , dreaming they will be able to say in years to come : ` I was there the night we beat Real Madrid . '  It turned out to be a game that will live in the memory but not for the reasons anyone hoped would be the case . The team sheet that Rodgers handed in before kick-off -- and the relentless debate that followed -- has seen to that .  Scroll down for video  Martin Skrtel reflects on the first-half , leaving the famous Bernabeu turf with Liverpool a goal down  Matchwinner Karim Benzema celebrates his strike after Liverpool 's rearguard were caught flatfooted  Rodgers has received some scathing criticism for making seven changes but I am not going to join the chorus of disapproval . Some of his decisions I did n't agree with , others I could completely understand . This is how I saw it .  When we got into the Bernabeu before kick-off , the full extent of how much Rodgers had altered his team had circulated and it left many high up in the away section , who already viewed the fixture with trepidation , fearing a night even more painful than the one Madrid inflicted at Anfield .  So then I began to study the team sheet . Javier Manquillo instead of Glen Johnson ? I could understand that . Manquillo has been Liverpool 's best right back this season . Kolo Toure for Dejan Lovren ? Again , no problem . Lovren 's erratic form meant he did n't deserve to be picked .  Fabio Borini for Mario Balotelli ? No issue there . Borini covered more ground in one game than Balotelli had done in 10 .  The absence of Philippe Coutinho did n't bother me , either , as he ca n't be trusted to deliver in big away games . Those players who came in all deserve to start against Chelsea .  Kolo Toure -LRB- left -RRB- had one of his best games in a Liverpool shirt , frequently frustrating Madrid 's stars  The ever-willing Fabio Borini -LRB- centre -RRB- put in more effort than the mercurial Mario Balotelli  Rodgers , remember , was n't ripping up a team that had won six straight matches . Nobody knows what Liverpool 's best XI is at present , not even the manager . And if we think the best he had were on show when Madrid came to Anfield , being on the end of a 3-0 battering weakens those claims . What 's more , Liverpool were never going to attack Madrid , so the changes did n't alter tactics . Anyone who believes Liverpool , under Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez , took on top teams away in Europe are living in a dream world . We did n't . Neither did the all-conquering sides in the 1970s and 1980s .  Yet what I could n't fathom were the omissions of Steven Gerrard -LRB- Rodgers 's captain -RRB- , Jordan Henderson -LRB- his vice-captain -RRB- and the best attacker , Raheem Sterling .  Those three , along with Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge , were the reason they came so close to winning the title and returned to Europe 's elite . After their efforts last season , they deserved to start in the Bernabeu .  The reason players love the Champions League so much is the thought of playing in an arena such as the Bernabeu . What are the chances of Stevie playing there again ? Will Jordan and Raheem ever have the opportunity in the future ?  You believe that you will get plenty of chances but I played for Liverpool for 17 years and a trip to the Bernabeu only came around once .  Jamie Carragher -LRB- right -RRB- stifles Raul with Xabi Alonso 's help during Liverpool 's 1-0 win in Madrid in 2009  Steven Gerrard -LRB- left -RRB- watches from the bench , alongside Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson  I felt those three deserved to be in the team and it had nothing to do with sentiment . They deserved to play because they are part of Liverpool 's best team .  I can imagine how they would have felt when Rodgers told them they were out . They would have been professional but they would have been devastated . When you grow up , you dream about playing against Real Madrid in the Bernabeu .  During my career , I won several big trophies but , believe me , nights in the Nou Camp , the San Siro and the Bernabeu , three of football 's cathedrals , are up there in my memories ; victories against Barcelona -LRB- February 2007 -RRB- , Inter Milan -LRB- March 2008 -RRB- and Real -LRB- February 2009 -RRB- were special .  This squad had a similar opportunity . Yes , Liverpool played reasonably well and showed more than they had for a number of weeks but relief that they did n't suffer a heavy defeat is not what following Liverpool in Europe should be about .  What confuses me is the importance the Chelsea game has been given . It is big , of course it is . But there are 28 matches to go .  Winning wo n't guarantee Liverpool 's place in the top four this season , in the same way a defeat wo n't leave them with too much ground to make up .  Gerrard -LRB- left -RRB- and Raheem Sterling were introduced in the 69th minute . Both should have started the game  The travelling fans were in good voice as ever , but left the Bernabeu with a narrow defeat  It baffles me when teams are more interested in qualifying for the competition next season than doing their best in the competition they are already in . Chelsea is n't make or break .  Had Manchester United -- a side with no European commitments -- been the visitors to Anfield and Liverpool had played abroad on Wednesday night , I could have seen why Rodgers wanted Gerrard , Henderson and Sterling refreshed , but not on this occasion .  They are playing a Chelsea side who have been away in Europe and had 24 hours less to recover . Liverpool stayed in Madrid after the game to train on Wednesday , too , so the players have n't had a disrupted night 's sleep to contend with . The physical demands have n't been so severe .  This , however , is where we are . When you are involved with Liverpool , things can be moving along quietly when an issue explodes and takes over .  This is one of those times .  Chelsea were held by Maribor in Slovenia and played a day after Liverpool in midweek  When Jose Mourinho makes an appearance at Anfield , it is usually an eventful one  City 's Euro excuses just do n't stack up  Manchester City now need a miracle to reach the Champions League knockout stages .  We keep hearing how they are unlucky because they have been drawn in tough groups but that does not wash . Manuel Pellegrini has enough quality at his disposal and should have got out of this group with Bayern Munich .  Why are they behind Roma ? The Italians have improved in the past two seasons but their squad does not boast the depth of City 's . Why have they failed to beat CSKA Moscow over two games ? Last season , City did the double over CSKA , who lost five out of six matches .  Vincent Kompany is in disbelief during City 's costly Champions League defeat to CSKA Moscow  Pablo Zabaleta sums up the mood after City concede a second early goal to Ajax in 2012 . They drew 2-2  Carlos Tevez leads the troops as they trudge off after City sank to a 1-0 defeat in Dortmund in 2012  This is n't like how it was for Manchester United and Arsenal when they were new to the competition . In the 1990s , they had British squads who were not used to playing in Europe , and it took time to adjust .  Yes , City have had some tough draws against Dortmund , Real Madrid and Munich but they were knocked out of a group by Napoli and failed to beat Ajax , home or away , in 2012 under Roberto Mancini . City have men who have played in Champions League and World Cup finals . They should be able to negotiate these tests . The excuses do n't stack up .  I said last week City 's squad needs to be broken up . Defeat by CSKA provided confirmation .  This week I 'm looking forward to ... seeing James McCarthy continue to dazzle  Everton have a rich history of building teams around influential central midfielders , headed by the ` Holy Trinity ' of Alan Ball , Howard Kendall and Colin Harvey .  In the 1980s , the team I grew up watching was inspired by Peter Reid and Paul Bracewell , and it is looking more and more like James McCarthy , the Republic of Ireland international , is going to keep up past traditions . He has the potential to be one of the best in the Barclays Premier League .  McCarthy was outstanding in Thursday 's 3-0 Europa League triumph over Lille and he will have a key role again at the Stadium of Light , as Everton look to apply pressure to the teams near the top .  James McCarthy -LRB- left -RRB- was again impressive in midweek as Everton strolled past Lille in the Europa League  Peter Reid -LRB- right -RRB- is challenged by Sheffield Wednesday 's Gary Shelton during 1985 's FA Cup semi-final  Paul Bracewell controls the ball during the 1989 Simod Cup final , which Everton lost to Nottingham Forest  Liverpool wanted to sign him when he was 16 and the better he plays for Everton , the more it is looking like a mistake that we allowed him to slip through our fingers . He did n't want to leave Scotland at that age but Liverpool 's loss has been Everton 's gain .  I am a big fan of McCarthy and I never fail to be impressed when I see him .  I do feel he needs to add more goals to his game but , if he can do that , he will be the real deal . Everton have a top player on their hands .   \n",

            "Rockets could take off from a spaceport in Britain within five years after ministers launched a search for a suitable site .  The UK Space Agency has been tasked with opening a site by 2018 , with the first flights having lift-off within a year .  A remote site , away from homes and businesses , will be required in the plan to better prepare the UK to deal with threats from space -- and offer trips to space tourists .  The government has launched a search for a site for a spaceport to become the UK 's answer to Cape Canaveral  Space minister David Willetts said the Government wanted to make sure Britain was more resilient to risks to space services and capabilities and enhance national security interests in space .  Experts from the defence and space industries will now work with transport agenies and business groups to draw up a list of potential sites for the spaceport .  Mr Willetts said : ` We want an area where there is not much civil airspace , where it is not very busy , '' said Mr Willetts .  ` It might be smaller airports , it might be underused or disused RAF airfields .  ` We 're starting to look at relatively remote parts of the country , ' he told the Telegraph .  Science minister David Willetts said the port would help protect Britain from threats from space  ` We 're rediscovering our great tradition of developing space vehicles and having a spaceport where we can launch will be part of that long term plan . '  He is working with Europe Minister David Lidington , Defence Equipment Minister Philip Dunne and Immigration Minister James Brokenshire in a cross-Whitehall effort to draw up the UK 's first ever National Space Security Policy .  Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson want to find a Europe base for his Virgin Galatctic space tourism enterprise .  Launches will begin in New Mexico in the US , but Sir Richard is looking for a site closer to home .  Sites in Scotland , Cornwall and Wales have previously been suggested to become Britain 's answer to Cape Canaveral .  Next year British astronaught Tim Peake will go into space to join the International Space Station next year .  But he will have to take off from Kazahkstan or French Guiana . The cross-government group looking for a site is expected to report back by July .  Mr Willetts highlighted close relationships with the United States , France and Germany and pledged the Government would continue to work on ` transparency and confidence-building measures ' at the United Nations .  Sir Richard Branson expects to start Virgin Galactic space tourism flights from next year , taking off from New Mexico in the US  Mr Willetts said : ` The policy also sets out how we intend to monitor and prepare against threats and hazards which might harm these interests , and our wider national security .  ` It identifies potential threats from state-sponsored and criminal attacks against satellite capabilities and services , and hazards such as severe solar storms and growing debris in space and how these might be prevented or the impact mitigated .  ` Through the National Space Security Policy , the Government will foster a closer space security partnership with industry and science that would allow more pooling of space security expertise and better sharing of information on space security risks , and on ways and opportunities to mitigate these .  ` We recognise that maintaining and enhancing co-operation with our international partners is also fundamental to our space security objectives .

            "A father is about to celebrate his ` first ' Christmas , after a brutal assault wiped his memory of the first 49 years of his life .  Andy Wickens , 50 , was left with amnesia after he intervened in a fight outside his home .  Mr Wickens , from Burgess Hill , West Sussex , was punched in the face and knocked unconscious when his head hit the pavement .  When he came around he could not remember getting married to his wife Petrina and did not recognise their three-year-old son , Jenson .  Andy Wickens , -LRB- right -RRB- , 50 , was knocked unconscious when he intervened in a fight outside his home , and when he woke up he had lost his memory . He could n't remember his wife Petrina 43 , -LRB- left -RRB- or their son . Now , he is about to re-live his first ever Christmas , as he ca n't remember the previous 49  Petrina Wickens -LRB- left -RRB- says her husband ca n't remember their marriage or anyone in his family . ` He is not the same man he used to be , ' she said . The pair are pictured on their wedding day  Since the incident in January , the father-of-three has been forced to rebuild relationships with friends and family , supported by a wife he does n't remember .  Mrs Wickens , 43 , said : ` It was outside his own house , he was cut by a punch to the head and had five stitches . '  ` He fell to the ground and smacked his head . '  She is mother to three-year-old Jenson and has two children from a previous marriage , while Mr Wickens also has two daughters from a previous marriage .  She continued : ` He ca n't remember anybody - not even his own daughters . It has been horrible .  ` He knows who I am now , but he ca n't remember getting married and he does n't recognise our son .  ` He does n't remember going to school , he does n't remember his brother and he does n't remember the birth of his own son .  She added : ` He is not the same man he used to be .  ` He does n't eat the same food or watch the same television programmes .  ` We have had to get to know each other all over again .  ` This year will be like his first Christmas , which is exciting but very sad at the same time . '  Mr Wickens , a vehicle plant worker , was fixing a car outside his home when he was met by a group of bystanders who watched him work .  Mr Wickens -LRB- centre -RRB- , a vehicle plant worker , was fixing a car outside his home when the attack happened . He is pictured with his wife Petrina -LRB- left -RRB- and their son Jenson -LRB- right -RRB- , now three , at his christening in 2011  Later that night two teenagers started acting aggressively towards some of the youngsters in the group .  After trying to defend the children , a heated argument broke out for about 15 minutes which resulted in Mr Wickens being violently attacked .  He was rushed to hospital where he stayed for six hours receiving stitches .  When he woke up , his family were panicked when he did n't recognise them , but doctors reassured them , saying his memory would gradually return .  But after months passed and he still could not remember , experts re-assessed and now say tit is unlikely his memory will ever return .  A 17-year-old man is due to appear in court in April charged with carrying out the assault , which has left Mr Wickens with amnesia and anxiety about leaving the house .  He now works from home and is visited by friends who reintroduce themselves in the hopes of rebuilding their friendship from scratch .  Mr Wickens says he is grateful for his family 's support . ` It is a horrible feeling not being able to remember the first 49 years of your life , ' he said . ' I look at photos of me from the past but they do not bring back any recollections . ' He is pictured getting ready for Christmas with his wife -LRB- left -RRB- and son -LRB- centre -RRB-  Mrs Wickens , who claims her husband 's attacker was drunk and high on drugs , said : ` He has got to know us all again over the year and is building up relationships with his friends , but a lot of people keep away .  ` They are worried about him not recognising them . It 's such a shame , and he 's missed out on so much , like his grand-daughter 's birth .  ` He 's completely lost the confidence he used to have . '  Mr Wickens said being unable to remember the past is terrifying .  He said : ` It is a horrible feeling not being able to remember the first 49 years of your life .  ' I look at photos of me from the past but they do not bring back any recollections .  ' I am so grateful to Petrina and my friends and family for sticking by me . '   \n",

            "By Matt Chorley , Mailonline Political Editor  PUBLISHED :  10:22 EST , 11 September 2013   |  UPDATED :  10:32 EST , 11 September 2013  Fewer than one in five jobs are now taxpayer-funded in a boost for David Cameron 's claim to a private sector-led recovery .  New figures reveal has public sector employment has fallen 104,000 in a year to 5.67 million , equivalent to 19 per cent of all jobs -- the lowest level since records began 14 years ago .  By contrast there are 380,000 more private sector workers than a year ago , taking the total number to a record high of 24.17 million .  New figures from the Office for National Statistics show how in the last decade public sector jobs have fallen from 5.9 million to 5.7 million  Mr Cameron seized on the figures in Prime Minister 's Questions as proof the government 's economic plan is working , pointing out that there are now 1.4 million private sector jobs than when the coalition was formed .  It means that 81 per cent of all workers are now employed by private firms .  The Office for National Statistics said today that in June 2013 there were 5.67 million people employed in the public sector , down 34,000 in March this year .  At the same time the number of private sector employees hit 24.17 million , up 114,000 from in March .  The proportion of people employed by the state , including in schools , hospitals and local government , peaked at 22.1 per cent at the end of 2009 , as the last Labour government sought to shield the public sector from the impacts of the financial crash .  Speaking in the Commons today , Mr Cameron said : ` Unemployment is now lower than it was at the general election , and the number of new net private sector jobs , which we have said was 1.3 million , is now 1.4 million , which is very welcome . '  And he turned his fire on the Labour party 's repeated opposition to the government 's economic plan .  Mr Cameron said : ` The Opposition told us that there would be no growth without plan B. Well , we have growth . They told us that unemployment would go up , not down .  ` They told us that growth of private sector jobs would never make up for the loss of public sector jobs . '  The unemployment rate now stands at 7.7 per cent , down from a peak of 8.4 per cent two years ago  Prime Minister David Cameron hailed the employment figures , with Chancellor George Osborne -LRB- centre -RRB- looking on  The PM went on : ` They have been wrong on every single one of those issues .  ` Of course we need to do more to help with living standards , but the only way to help with living standards sustainably is to deliver growth in the economy , and we are ; to keep interest rates and mortgage rates low , and we are ; and to cut people 's taxes by raising the personal allowance .  ` All the things this Government have done ; things his Government would never do . '  The number of women in work for May to July 2013 was 13.89 million , 318,000 higher than five years previously .  ` This increase in female employment over the last five years was almost entirely due to part-time employment , ' the ONS said .  The number of people claiming Jobseeker 's Allowance fell in August by 32,600 from July to 1.4 million , today 's figures also showed .  While overall employment levels have risen in the last five years , it is almost entirely due to people taking part-time jobs  While the CPI rate of inflation is running at more than 2.5 per cent , wages rose by just 1.1 per cent last month  July 's claimant count was also revised lower , and the combined 68,900 fall in claimants in July and August was the biggest two-month drop since June 1997 .  But the continued squeeze on household incomes was highlighted by a 1.1 per cent increase in average weekly earnings between May and July versus a year earlier .  Labour leader Ed Miliband told MPs that the only month wages had risen under the Coalition was the month when bankers delayed their bonuses to take advantage of the cut in the 50p top rate of tax .  He added : ` We are in the middle of the slowest recovery in 100 years . ' \n",

            "A group of friends has launched Britain 's first darts team for the blind , by using string to help them find the bullseye .  Humorously named ` The Optimists ' , teammates Richard Pryor , Rachael Beresford , Carol Pirret and Sharon Waters admit some wayward darts have already caused damage to the inside of their local pub The Dolphin Inn in Grampound , Cornwall .  The group guide their darts with a piece of string attached to the board which helps them feel where it is .  Scroll down for video  A group of friends have launched Britain 's first darts team for the blind , by using string to help them find the bullseye  Rachael Beresford - a member of the ` The Optimists ' Dart team at the Dolphin Inn in Grampound , Cornwall . The team guide their darts with a piece of string attached to the board  When a player heads to the line they grab the chord with their spare hand and throw with the other  Then when a player heads to the line they grab the cord with their spare hand and throw with the other .  The friends have been hard at work honing their skills , ready for their first match , and father-of-two Mr Pryor , 68 , said they are now hitting the board about two out of every three throws .  The former social worker said : ` The landlord mentioned that the Rotary Club had organised for pubs to take part in a fast darts competition .  ` He asked if we wanted to put in a blind darts team . After three pints I am up for anything and we said yes .  ` No one has been injured yet , although there has been quite a bit of damage to the door and around the board .  ` Just because you ca n't see it does n't mean it 's the end of the world . I have been blind for nearly 40 years and I have a superb time , I would n't swap it for anything .  ` However , on the night people might want to stand back a little bit as I do n't think we get any points for hitting the spectators . '  Mr Pryor went completely blind over the course of three days when his retinas haemorrhaged irreversibly and without warning 38 years ago .  But he refuses to give up on his favourite hobbies and activities , and organises a monthly support group for the blind and visually impaired .  Sharon Waters lines up a shot . The four wholly visually impaired teammates will take part in their first game on Thursday  Team member Carol Pirret has the best vision of the group but is still partially sighted due to a condition called Pseudoxanthoma elasticum or PXE  Ms Pirret said : ` I 'm very excited for the competition , it 's the only social thing I really do . It 's a good bit of fun joining in the darts team '  It was through this group that he advertised for players and was soon swamped with volunteers .  Team mate Sharon Walters , 46 , a mum-of-two and former carer , has serious visual impairment due to a benign brain tumour .  Rachael Beresford , 39 , a DJ and former hospice volunteer , is completely blind due to glaucoma and diabetes .  Making up the foursome is Carol Pirret , 53 , who has the best vision of the group but is still partially sighted due to a condition called Pseudoxanthoma elasticum or PXE .  The team have until Thursday to perfect their technique before they take part in the fast darts contest , where teams score as many points as possible in 90 minutes .  There are 14 other clubs taking part this year - but all the others can see .  Ms Walters said : ` Seeing as it 's for charity I thought , `` Oh why not ? '' It 's going to be fun , I think , but I do n't fancy our chances . '  Team founder Richard Pryor said the friends have been hard at work honing their skills , ready for their first match , and are now hitting the board about two out of every three throws  He said : ` Just because you ca n't see it does n't mean it 's the end of the world . I have been blind for nearly 40 years and I have a superb time , I would n't swap it for anything '  But they admit they are causing a little damage to the 17th Century Dolphin Inn , in Cornwall  Ms Pirret said : ` I 'm very excited for the competition , it 's the only social thing I really do . It 's a good bit of fun joining in the darts team . '  Mrs Beresford played darts before losing her sight .  She added : ' I used to play for fun and it 's great to give it another go . I did n't think I would be able to do it but so far I 'm getting most of them on the board . '  Donna Fryer , 41 , landlady of the 17th-century Dolphin Inn , said she was n't too worried about the damage caused by stray arrows .  She said : ' I think it 's great they are entering the competition .  ` They support us so often , by coming in here for their meetings . It 's great to be able to support them back by letting them play in the competition here .  ` There 's been a few holes in the walls , but that does n't matter - it all adds to the character of the pub .

He told Daybreak : ` Two separate things - why I decided to write the book is I wanted to tell my story about my time in politics and all the lessons that I learnt from it and , indeed , the lessons that both the Labour party and other parties can learn from the way that I got brought into the political system and the way that effectively started to operate in a way that was unacceptable .  ` In terms of why I 'm publishing it now , I was always going to write this book at some stage , I had more lucrative offers to publish it close to the general election when it would have caused more of a distraction and chose not to do that . I though the earlier I published it the better . '  Referring to the incident with Mr Holmes , Mr Dale later wrote on Twitter : ` Oh dear , I seem to have gone nuclear ...

            "By Daily Mail Reporter  PUBLISHED :  06:04 EST , 23 November 2012   |  UPDATED :  09:52 EST , 23 November 2012  A hilarious YouTube video clip showing four men forming a ` human bicyle ' on an airport travelator has gone viral with more than half a million hits in under a week .  Billed as ` four bored Scousers at Manchester Airport ' , the 17-second clip starts with a general view of a moving walkway . Half way through , four men appear , with one on his back and using his hands as ` pedals ' , one at the front as ` handlebars ' , one bent over as the ` seat ' and one on top as the ` cyclist ' .  But the clip , which has been shared by celebrities including Scouse comic John Bishop , may not be all as it seems . Eagle-eyed viewers have noticed the footage is n't filmed in England at all - and the men involved may not even be from Liverpool .  Scroll down for video  The ` bored Scousers ' begin their unconventional journey down what is supposedly as Manchester Airport travelator  But users have cast doubt on the true origins of the men , with some saying they are actually from the Czech Republic  YouTube user Sidisek wrote in the comments section below the video : ` They speak Czech - I know because I am Czech . '  Airport sources said the home-made movie was actually shot at Prague or Budapest Airport , although the passengers may have been booked on a flight to Manchester .  Despite doubts over the origin of the jokers , Scousers left comments in their droves . Mikesep wrote it ` made him proud to be a Scouser ' , while Tyrone Waldrin said : ` I 'm a Cockney from London and I 've got to say I love the Scousers , proper salt of the earth people , great banter . '  Dubious YouTube viewers are also sceptical the clip was filmed in Manchester , with some suggesting Budapest was the real location  Connor1996 reckons Liverpudlians have ` the best humour they 're the funniest people around ' , while Rezza6 said the video was the ` best thing the Scousers have produced in years ' .  The video has n't impressed everyone though , with a spokesman for Manchester Airport only offering the faintest of praise .  ` We can think of better ways to entertain yourself while waiting in the terminals for an aircraft . ' said the spokesman .  ` They 've demonstrated an interesting approach to innovation , however , with their bicycle design but it 's not something we would recommend on a moving walkway . Perhaps a play area would be more suitable . ' \n",

            "Conclusions : Sir William McKay , a former House of Commons clerk , has said that more needs to be done to ensure English MPs have more control over England-only policies  Laws that affect England alone should no longer be passed in the Commons without the consent of a majority of English MPs , an inquiry has concluded .  The changes are designed to end the problem of unpopular measures affecting England , but not Scotland , being approved only with the support of Scottish MPs .  In 2004 , for example , Tony Blair pushed through tuition fees for England even though most English MPs voted against the policy .  It passed only because Scottish Labour MPs packed the lobbies in favour of the move -- despite the fact tuition fees would not apply north of the border because the devolved executive there had rejected the plan .  An independent commission , led by former House of Commons clerk Sir William McKay , has said more needs to be done to ensure English MPs have better control .  The report was commissioned by the Cabinet Office last year , and ministers will now consider whether to implement its conclusions .  It calls for a compromise ` double-lock ' system , under which laws that apply in England alone are approved first by English MPs before they go to a vote before the whole Commons , which comprises MPs of all four nations of the UK .  The report suggests any England-only laws should first be considered by a committee made up of MPs representing English constituencies .  Laws would not go forward unless they achieved the support of this committee , whose make-up should reflect the balance of parties in England .  The legislation would then be voted on by all MPs in the Commons -- be they English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish .  This is to ensure that MPs from other countries are not relegated to ` second class ' status .  Greater English voice : Sir William 's commission suggests laws that apply in England alone are approved first by English MPs before they go to a vote before the whole House of Commons  So , in effect , every law would have to be supported by both a representative majority of English MPs and a majority of all of Britain 's MPs .  The new regime is designed to solve the so-called ` West Lothian ' question , which asks why it is that Scottish , Welsh or Northern Irish MPs have the same right to vote at Westminster as any English MP now that large areas of policy are devolved to national parliaments and assemblies .  Many Conservatives have called for purely ` English votes for English laws ' , with MPs from other nations barred from voting on such issues .  But Labour says to do that would undermine the Union . The party is also concerned that , because it often relies on Scottish MPs for a majority at Westminster , English votes for English laws could make governing impossible .  Tuition fees : Tony Blair pushed the policy through for England even though most English MPs voted against the policy , by using Scottish Labour MPs to back him in the vote  Now Sir William 's commission has unveiled a compromise which maintains the integrity of the UK but provides a greater English voice .  He said : ` Surveys have shown that people in England are unhappy about the existing arrangements , and support change . There is a feeling that England is at a disadvantage , and that it 's not right that MPs representing the devolved nations should be able to vote on matters affecting England .  ` The status quo clearly can not be sustained . Our proposals retain the right of a UK-wide majority to make the final decisions where they believe UK interests or those of a part of the UK other than England should prevail . '  A Cabinet Office spokesman said : ` We will give the report very serious consideration before we respond . ' \n",

            "This panda did n't want to go back into its enclosure at all .  As its trainer tried to leave the panda pen at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding , this animal decided it still wanted some human company .  Latching on to the trainer 's leg , the panda can be seen giving the man a hug hug and refusing to let down .  The 41 second video filmed in China 's southwestern city of Chengdu has gone viral as animal lovers around the world enjoy watching the adorable scene .  The research base was established in 1987 and it carries out a range of research and conservation work to protect the endangered species .  During the video the first panda grabs the right leg of the keeper just below the knee and the animal holds onto it for about 25 seconds while a second giant panda watches on .  The man finally manages to extricate himself and leaves the enclosure shutting the gate behind him .  But the pandas appear somewhat distressed as they clamber up the bars of the cage and watch the handler leave .  Grip : The panda has a tight grip of the keeper 's right leg during the initial stages of the video  Struggle : The research base employee manages to loosen the grip of the panda slightly  Gate : Finally the man gets his leg free , however , the panda is still making it difficult for him to close the gate  Almost there : The pandas appear very agitated as they watch the keeper lock the gate  Escape : The keeper manages to lock the pandas in the enclosure after his unexpected struggle   \n",

RoomAlive is a Holodeck-like concept from Microsoft which turns your whole living room into an immersive gaming experience  A Microsoft research project called RoomAlive could soon be bringing holodecks to your living room .  The system of cameras projects images and animations onto the wall , letting the user interact with virtual objects .  It can map the geometry of a room in minutes and provide an immersive holodeck-like experience , such as projecting critters running up the walls to shoot or firing incoming ` missiles ' to dodge .  RoomAlive is being developed by Projection Mapping Central at Microsoft 's Redmond Campus in Washington .  The prototype technology can turn any room into an augment reality experience .  This includes games where the ` player ' has to duck and weave from incoming fire , or strike enemies running along the walls .  RoomAlive uses six Kinect sensors to track the movement of the player in the room .  A projector depth-camera unit known as a procam , meanwhile , uses a wide field of view projector , Kinect sensor and a computer to display the images on the walls .   \n",

Wearing anything from a floral blouse to full-on druid robes , these women are among the wiccans , traditional healers , enchantresses and druids photographed by Polish photographer Katarzyna Majak .  In her fascinating series Women Of Power , Ms Majak wanted to celebrate the alternative spiritual paths taken by women in her largely Catholic homeland .  Powerful : Elwinga , a contemporary druid -LRB- left -RRB- , and artist Natalia LL -LRB- right -RRB- , were among the women photographed by Polish photographer Katarzyna Majak  Subjects : Listener Kasia Emilia -LRB- left -RRB- and Bea -LRB- right -RRB- , who Ms Majak describes as ` the one who listens to the woods ' , were among the 29 women featured in the series  Each of the subjects , who were aged between 30 and 80 , posed with her preferred talisman , displaying a range of items including daggers , plants , and sticks wrapped in brightly coloured beads and decorated with feathers .  Ms Majak , who has exhibited her images and compiled them for a book , said she embarked on her project after feeling a void in her own life .  She decided she wanted to speak to women who identified with the spirituality of their ancestors who practised paganism , witchcraft and shamanism prior to the introduction of Christianity to Poland .  Focus : Joanna -LRB- left -RRB- who leads women 's circles and ceremonies , and Anna -LRB- right -RRB- a whisperer  Her striking portraits aim to turn the stereotypical imagery of witchcraft , and asked what being a witch meant to one of the subjects in the series , she replied ` A witch is a woman of knowledge who takes a broom and sweeps to cleanse the world . '  Some of the women have taken a great risk by agreeing to be photographed by Ms Majak , and her collection marked the first time that many of them publicly acknowledged their beliefs or religion .  Among the 29 women Ms Majak spoke to were spiritual healers , or whisperers , from close to the Belarusian border the who combine their religion with superstitions to heal using the power of prayer .  Spiritual : Each of the women posed with their chosen talisman  Ritual : A video still showing healer Maria in front of the Palace of Culture in Warsaw  Others had grandmothers who worked as healers or visionaries , and were striving to revive these ancient traditions .  Many of her subjects had even travelled abroad to North America , Peru , or New Zealand , learning about traditions in these far-flung countries and mixing them with their own knowledge .  Buddhists , Wiccans , Ma-uri followers , Asatrus , Druids and Left Hand Path followers are also represented in the series of photographs .

            "Ministers must not ignore the growing threat of violence from far-right extremists in Britain in the wake of ISIS terrorism and crimes involving UK Muslims , a senior Home Office adviser said today .  The anonymous expert on right-wing extremism warned that the Government is putting an emphasis on the ` global jihadist agenda ' while possibly ignoring the growth of the far-right at home .  The adviser warned of the importance of preventing a violent attack being carried out by the far-right in Britain in the future .  Danger : Fighters from ISIS march in Raqqa , Syria , earlier this year . A Home Office adviser has warned ministers must not ignore the growing threat of violence from far-right extremists in Britain in the wake of ISIS terrorism  He told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : ` I have been working with people from the far-right for about 27 years now .  ` I can see increases in some of these groups and membership in some of these groups based on things that are happening nationally here and internationally .  ` A lot of the emphasis is put on the global jihadist agenda , which is fine , and it needs to be , but I really feel that this agenda , the repercussions of some of that in terms of the far-right ca n't be ignored .  ` I would n't want to get to the point where something happens and we look back and think actually we should have addressed that as well . '  The expert said he had met someone who wanted to put everyone who was not white British into Nazi-style death camps .  Knowledge : The senior Home Office adviser said he had been working with people from the far-right for about 27 years . The Home Office building in Westminster is pictured  He told the programme : ` I had one person who said he would like to implement death camps here in the UK and when I asked who he would like to put in the death camps , he just listed everyone that he did n't see as white British . So that was every Asian person , every black person . '  ' A lot of the emphasis is put on the global jihadist agenda , which is fine , and it needs to be , but I really feel that this agenda , the repercussions of some of that in terms of the far-right ca n't be ignored '  Senior Home Office adviser  Labour former communities secretary Hazel Blears said the Government needs to better support the Muslim majority who condemn Islamist extremism .  She called on ministers to beef up the anti-extremism Prevent programme and bring different communities together .  Efforts should be made to work with more young Muslims and encourage people from the community to become school governors and magistrates , she added .  Miss Blears said : ` I honestly do not think that the Government is doing enough in the whole Prevent programme to bring people together and to support the Muslim majority who are absolutely horrified at what 's been happening . '  A Home Office spokesman told MailOnline : ` The Prevent strategy tackles all forms of extremism , including from the far-right . As the shocking murder of Mohammed Saleem last year demonstrated , we should not underestimate the threat it poses .  Improvements needed : Labour former communities secretary Hazel Blears -LRB- pictured -RRB- said the Government needs to better support the Muslim majority who condemn Islamist extremism  ` By fundamentally revising Prevent in 2011 , and through the work of the Extremism Task Force , we have improved the way we tackle extremism and radicalisation . Since 2011 , we have implemented a raft of practical measures to strengthen our approach in prisons , schools , universities and online . '  And an Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman told MailOnline : ` We are not seeing an increase in right-wing extremist attacks or activity .  ` The police take the threat from all forms of extremism extremely seriously and the specific threat from right-wing extremism is constantly monitored '  Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman  ` There 's not been a notable increase in anti-Islamic hate crime - however , some Muslims communities in the UK feel more vulnerable due to the extensive coverage of terrorist activity and the extreme views of Islam promoted by ISIS and other terrorist groups .  ` The police take the threat from all forms of extremism extremely seriously and the specific threat from right-wing extremism is constantly monitored .  ` Police work to prevent people being drawn into extremism through a variety of methods including every day neighbourhood policing and specific community engagement programmes . The Channel programme also provides tailored support to those who are at most risk of radicalisation . ' \n",

            "Midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain loves playing in such an attacking Arsenal team - but accepts they will always have to work at keeping it tight at the back .  Arsenal recovered from going behind in the north London derby to a breakaway Tottenham goal for Nacer Chadli as Oxlade-Chamberlain 's close-range strike secured a 1-1 draw .  Arsene Wenger 's side , however , had enjoyed plenty of possession and should have been ahead before a lapse in concentration from defensive midfielder Matheiu Flamini allowed Christian Eriksen to snatch the ball and set-up a swift counter .  Arsenal 's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain slots home the equaliser against local rivals Tottenham on Saturday  Oxlade-Chamberlain accepts it is a part of Arsenal 's game which can hurt them , but is worth it for what the Gunners offer going forwards .  ` That is the risk you take when you play the way we play football , ' said England international Oxlade-Chamberlain .  ` We try to take control of games , we like to set the tempo , We send a lot of bodies forward in a positive and attacking fashion and you do leave yourself at times a little bit vulnerable to the counter-attack .  Oxlade-Chamberlain celebrates netting against Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby at the Emirates  Arsene Wenger 's side salvaged a point thanks to Oxlade-Chamberlain 's first Gunners goal since February  ` It is just important that when we do , we have got people in the team that are willing to take the responsibility of holding back and being there to stop counter-attacks .  ` But , yeah , I do love playing in this team and the style of play that we do , as I think all the players could say .  ` We do , though , need to obviously be careful and make sure we are defending at the same time as when we are attacking .  ` It is something we have always worked on because it is an area I am sure teams look at to try and break us down , so we have got to be ready for that . '  Oxlade-Chamberlain handles the ball last season at Chelsea , which resulted in Kieran Gibbs being sent off  Despite attempts to reason with referee Andre Mariner after Kieran Gibbs was sent-off at Chelsea last season  Arsenal head to leaders Chelsea next weekend , where they were thumped 6-0 last season , in what was Wenger 's 1,000 th match in charge .  Oxlade-Chamberlain , though , insisted that result would not make Arsenal any less cavalier .  ` We do understand what happened there last season . Maybe we have got a point to prove there , we know this year we have got to step up in the big games and get some results in them , ' he said .  ` We are really looking forward to that game and we definitely give Chelsea the respect they deserve , but , at the same time , I have belief in my team-mates and we do in ourselves to be able to go to a place like Chelsea and set the tempo and hopefully take control of the game .  ` There will be times in the game I am sure when they have a spell , because they are a top team .  ` They are going to have their time , we are going to have ours , we just have to make sure that when we do have our chances we make them count . '  Aaron Ramsey of Arsenal holds his leg as he lies on the pitch after picking up an injury against Tottenham  Arsenal were left counting the cost of injuries against Spurs , with captain Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey limping off in the first half , before Jack Wilshere , who suffered a twisted ankle , was replaced for the final 30 minutes .  Wenger was at a loss to explain why soft tissue injuries continue to dog his squad . ' I do n't know if we really have to look at it because there is no logic there , ' said the Arsenal manager .  ` It is two players who were not involved in the -LRB- cup -RRB- game in the week . We had quite a light week for them and we have to analyse what happened to them . I do n't understand . '  Like our Arsenal Facebook page .

            "Chelsea can take another step closer towards securing the Premier League title when they face Arsenal on Sunday , and Jose Mourinho 's side stepped up their preparations for the Emirates showdown in training on Friday .  The league leaders were put through their paces at their Cobham training headquarters just a couple of days before a London derby against Arsene Wenger 's side .  Mourinho has never lost to Wenger in 12 outings , and he will be hoping 13 is not unlucky as well on Sunday as his side look to extend their 10-point lead over the Gunners .  Chelsea trained at their base in Cobham on Friday ahead of their game against Arsenal  Chelsea 's Spanish midfielder prepares to face his former club Arsenal at the weekend  Didier Drogba has an excellent record against Arsenal and could start up front  Cesc Fabregas will make his first return to the Emirates , but another of Chelsea 's summer signings Diego Costa is a doubt for the clash due to injury .  That would mean Didier Drogba , who was seen training at Cobham on Friday , or Loic Remy could start up front for Chelsea at the Emirates .  At his press conference on Friday , Mourinho said : ` Didier for sure is good , is fine . Remy , not for sure . And Diego , let 's make a decision tomorrow .  Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho takes charge of the training session at Cobham on Friday  Belgian star Eden Hazard is in line to be named PFA Player of the Year this weekend  Dominic Solanke is in reserve , having missed Chelsea 's Under 21 team match on Thursday , and will be on the substitutes ' bench as back-up to Drogba if Costa is not fit .  Costa has scored 19 Premier League goals this season , including one in the 2-0 win against Arsenal in October .  But Costa has missed the last two matches - wins against QPR and Manchester United - after a recurrence of the hamstring problems which have plagued him .  ` He 's a very important player for us , but the reality is we are coping with the difficulties of every match without him , ' Mourinho added .  Teenage striker Dominic Solanke joined the first team for their training session at Cobham on Friday  Youngster Solanke with Hazard in training ahead of the Arsenal game at the Emirates  Mourinho has never lost to Arsene Wenger in 12 previous meetings between the pair  ` We played amazingly well during the most part of the season , scoring a lot of goals and controlling games very well through the quality of our possession .  ` In the last period we are more strategic , less artistic , but we are having results . I would love Diego to be back , but I trust the other people . '  Eden Hazard was also on target in the autumn home win over Arsenal .  The Belgium playmaker is expected to be crowned PFA Player of the Year on Sunday , but Mourinho insists collective honours are more important for Hazard .  Chelsea striker Drogba executes a sliding challenge on his team-mate Hazard as he tries to win the ball  Hazard gets physical with Brazilian Oscar during the training session on Friday at Cobham  Sport analysts BSports are predicting a tight match , with Arsenal slight favourites to beat Chelsea  The Blues boss also played down the prospect of Hazard moving to Real Madrid after the 24-year-old 's idol Zinedine Zidane , now a coach at Real , lauded him this week .  Mourinho said : ` We just signed a new contract with him -LRB- until 2021 -RRB- . We did n't put a gun to his head . He had a lot of time to think about it .  ` He made a commitment for the future of the team , signing a very good contract . I do n't think he 's interested in going . '  Mourinho recently said every player has a price .  Asked to put a figure on Hazard , he said : ` That 's a good question . I have my idea about it . ' \n",

            "By Martin Beckford  PUBLISHED :  20:01 EST , 22 June 2013   |  UPDATED :  03:01 EST , 15 August 2013  Two of the women accused of covering up a damning internal report into a failed hospital inspection insisted last night that they never wanted their names to be kept secret .  Jill Finney , former deputy chief executive of the Care Quality Commission , and Anna Jefferson , the watchdog 's media manager , both insisted they wanted the truth to come out , despite allegations that they wanted heavy criticism of the CQC to be withheld from the public .  In the explosive report about the cover-up published this week , the two women were initially referred to as ` Mr G ' and ` Mr F ' after lawyers warned that naming them could breach the Data Protection Act or lead to libel lawsuits .  Protected : Anna Jefferson , the media manager of the Care Quality Commission , was not initially named in a damning report into a failed hospital inspection  This led to further accusations of a cover-up and political pressure forced the CQC to reveal their identities , along with those of then CQC Chief Executive Cynthia Bower .  But now Miss Finney , who lost her new job at internet firm Nominet in the wake of the row , and Miss Jefferson , who is on maternity leave , have condemned the botched attempt to anonymise the report as it made the story far bigger .  Miss Finney , former Deputy Chief Executive at the CQC , said : ` It was very clear that the redaction was worthless . I feel that the CQC threw a scrap of information to the media and ensured there would be an extended feeding frenzy .  ` I believe the Grant Thornton report should not have been published in the way it was this week . '  Miss Jefferson , due to return to the CQC as Media Manager next month , said : ` I thought it was a very poor decision to anonymise it in the first place . '  Under fire : Cynthia Bower , chief executive of the Care Quality Commission , was ` round the table ' when the decision was taken to delete evidence of a botched CQC inspection  Asked if she felt like a scapegoat , she replied : ` I certainly feel extremely vulnerable and I 'm astonished that this has happened . That I could be on maternity leave and exposed to this , with absolutely no evidence at all . It 's like living in a nightmare .  ` I did absolutely nothing wrong and I 've got evidence that I actually pushed for more scrutiny . '  The CQC had known as far back as 2009 that there had been 12 ` Serious Untoward Incidents ' including child deaths at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria .  But it only launched a full investigation into the Morecambe Bay trust that runs the hospital in December 2011 .  Consultants Deloitte said in a previously unreported review that ` there may have been an earlier missed opportunity ' to intervene .  Astonishingly the CQC had no ` written record ' of why it decided to investigate Morecambe Bay , where some 38 babies were delivered stillborn between 2002 and 2009 , 15 more died in the first two weeks of birth and three mothers had died while pregnant or within a year of giving birth .  The watchdog carried out an internal review of its earlier inspections , but it was never published .  Baby deaths : Joshua Titcombe being held by his sister Emily at Furness Hospital in Barrow . He died of an infection which could have been cured with antibiotics  The latest high-profile account published by consultants Grant Thornton this week found that senior figures at the CQC agreed to suppress the account of their failings in monitoring University Hospitals Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust .  But speaking separately to the Mail on Sunday , Miss Finney and Miss Jefferson strongly rejected the claims against them .  They say that rather than containing devastating revelations about the health watchdog 's failures , the internal review actually blamed hospital managers .  Miss Jefferson said it was a ` whitewash ' rather than a ` smoking gun ' .  Miss Finney said : ` I , and others , made it clear to Grant Thornton that we thought the document let CQC off the hook and we thought it could have been far tougher . '  The pair , interviewed separately by the Mail on Sunday , deny there was any order to delete the review and stop it being published under Freedom of Information laws .  Poor care : The CQC had known as far back as 2009 that there had been 12 ¿ Serious Untoward Incidents ¿ including child deaths at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria  Miss Jefferson said she had actually called for a better , external review of the Morecambe Bay case last July and kept minutes of a meeting with new CQC Chief Executive David Behan where she ` pushed very hard ' for this .  Miss Finney said : ` There was no instruction to delete , but there was a need to do further work . 'Em ployment lawyers are now looking into what action can be taken against the CQC officials , which could include stripping former Chief Executive Miss Bower and her deputy Miss Finney of their multi-million pound pensions .  Miss Jefferson is due to return from maternity leave next month but it is unclear if she will be able to return to her old job .  The Metropolitan Police have been asked by an MP to look into the alleged cover-up at the CQC while Cumbria Police are still looking into the death of one baby in the care of the trust , Joshua Titcombe . \n",

            "Police in San Francisco have discovered the mummified body of an elderly woman in a house said to be owned by a hoarder .  The property in the Richmond area is said to have been crawling with rats , black widow spiders , dog feces and 300 bottles of urine .  The remains which were removed from the house on Saturday are believed to be that of Anna Ragin who lived with her 65-year-old daughter Carolyn .  Police removed the body , believed to be that of Anna Ragin , from the property in the Richmond area of San Francisco . Authorities said the home was covered in debris , including dog feces and bottles of urine  Neighbors told The San Francisco Chronicle the mother had not been seen for years .  According to records another man , Archibald Ragin , lived at the property but died 15 years ago at the age of 101 .  Carolyn , said to be a retired Pacific Bell worker , was taken to hospital after her mother 's body was removed from the house .  Supervisor Eric Mar , a representative in charge of the area , told the Chronicle : ` The police captains I 've spoken with tell me this is the worst case of hoarding they have ever seen . '  He was concerned for the health and safety of the residents , but questioned how the situation in the property could have gotten to such a point .  Mr Mar said : ` We certainly want seniors to stay in their communities as long as possible , but when people are n't getting adequate health care and attention , this is what happens .  ` This appears to be a nightmare of what can happen when people age in place for too long , ' he added . ` We need to identify what the triggers are for the city to step in . '  He told the Daily Mail Online that he heard the body was wrapped up in a carpet and described that , from the outside , it looked like the home was abandoned .  Residents said the woman had not been seen in years while police described it as the worst case of hoarding they had ever seen  When city workers arrived to clean up the body on Wednesday , they reportedly struggled to get in the door because the house was filled with so much debris .  The mess was said to have included mold and piles of trash that reached the ceiling .  They were forced to call in professional workers .  The Chronicle quote a firefighter saying the body was lightweight and wrapped in a blanket . It is not clear where it was discovered . \n",

            "By Jason Groves  PUBLISHED :   20:22 EST , 8 January 2014   | UPDATED :   04:59 EST , 9 January 2014  David Cameron 's father-in-law last night revealed he has had an extraordinary ` reconciliation ' with Mandy Rice-Davies - the former showgirl who claimed to have had an affair with his father during the Profumo scandal .  Miss Rice-Davies famously responded to the third Viscount Astor 's denials of an affair with the immortal line : ` Well , he would , would n't he ? '  Writing in the Spectator magazine his son , the fourth viscount , said his father ` never recovered his health and died a couple of years later ' .  ` Charming ' : Lord Astor said Mandy Rice-Davies , pictured in 1963 , was ` absolutely charming and had very kind words to say about my father ' after a recent meeting  But Lord Astor said he had an unlikely reconciliation with Miss Rice-Davies at a performance of Andrew Lloyd-Webber 's new musical on the Profumo affair .  He said it was a ` great plus ' to have met her , adding : ` She was absolutely charming , and had very kind words to say about my father . It was a most unexpected moment - a reconciliation of sorts , and an uplifting footnote after all these years .  ` And what of the accusation ? Well any girl of 19 who can get into the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations , whether with something true or not true , has to be rather admired . '  Chance encounter : Lord Astor , left , bumped into Mandy Rice-Davies , right , during a performance of Andrew Lloyd-Webber 's new musical on the Profumo affair  Lord Astor , stepfather to Samantha Cameron , also revealed that the Profumo affair might never have happened if his father 's filly Ambiguity had not won the Oaks at Epsom in 1953 .  The proceeds from the win paid for the heated swimming pool at stately home Cliveden , where John Profumo saw showgirl Christine Keeler , a friend of Miss Rice-Davies , swimming naked at a party in July 1961 .  Third Viscount Astor , pictured at his wedding in London , ` never recovered his health ' following the scandal  Mr Profumo , then Secretary of State for War in Harold Macmillan 's government , was forced to resign in 1962 after it emerged he had an affair with Miss Keeler while she was also alleged to be having an affair with the Russian naval attaché Yevgeny Ivanov .  Lord Astor said Mr Profumo had met Miss Keeler after a party at Cliveden hosted by his father .  When the party relocated to the pool they met with a separate group hosted by his father 's colourful osteopath Stephen Ward , who surrounded himself with young showgirls .  ` Two worlds collided , ' Lord Astor said .  ` First into the walled garden was Valerie Profumo , who anxiously covered up a topless Christine Keeler with a towel before the other guests arrived . But Christine had already been spotted by Jack Profumo . '  Lord Astor said his father found Mr Ward 's treatments helped ease his migraines and neuritis .  He said he ` fell under his spell ' and allowed Mr Ward to live in a cottage on the estate because ` it suited him to be treated after hunting on Saturday 's . '  He went on : ` I remember the afternoons by the pool when Ward and his girlfriends came to swim , with other families from cottages on the estate , usually when my father and stepmother were away .  Party time : Lord Astor said Mr Profumo had met Miss Keeler , right , at a party at Cliveden hosted by osteopath Stephen Ward , centre , pictured also with Penny Marshall , front  Scandal : John Profumo , poses as the new Secretary of State for War , at the War Office before the scandal of his affair with call-girl Christine Keeler broke  ` One of the girls taught me how to do backflips from the diving board , but sadly I do n't remember who she was . All were well-behaved because Nanny Greene , large and in full uniform , presided over the pool sternly . No bad behaviour got past her . '  Lord Astor says that Mr Ward was an ` arch manipulator ' who was never a great fried of his father .  Mr Ward took a fatal overdose while awaiting the verdict on his trial for living off immoral earnings , of which he was later convicted .  Miss Rice-Davies 's famous comment was made when she appeared as a witness during the trial .  Lord Astor said : ` It was a scandal that exposed the hypocrisy of the establishment that Ward so offended , exposed the dishonesty of the police and prosecuting authorities and of the security service . But I do n't think there were the real villains or heroes that a musical requires .  ` This is because , in the end , the characters in the Profumo scandal were all victims - victims of a maelstrom that none could escape . Few survived unscathed . '   \n",

            "By Chris Pleasance  When one very excited 10-year-old claimed to have found a mummy in his grandmother 's attic , it took his parents a while to realise he was n't making it up .  But , unfortunately for little Alexander Kettler , from Diepholz , his historic find has proved to be a little less exciting than originally thought .  It turns out that the supposed 2000-year-old Egyptian mummy is actually made of plastic , a discovery made after scientists finally unwrapped the corpse for inspection .  Mysterious find : A 10-year-old German boy found what appeared to be a mummy in a sarcophagus in his grandmother 's attic  Experts now claim they were fooled by a chemical spray which made the bones appear real .  Lutz Gaebler , a Lower Saxony prosecutor who had declared the ` mummy ' was 2,000 years old , has admitted that bone X-rays have proven him wrong .  ` The mummy was unwrapped , and we have seen relatively quickly that the ingredients are not ancient , ' he said .  In an unexpected and slightly macabre twist , the mummy did contain a genuine skull , though an arrowhead found lodged in it appeared to come from a child 's toy .  Relic : Mr Kettler believed that his father may have brought an unusual souvenir back from a trip to north Africa in the 1950s  Interest peaked the the so-called ` mummy of Diepholz ' after it was found in the corner of an attic last month .  Lutz Wolfgang Kettler , father of the boy who discovered it , theorised that his own father may have bought it while travelling in the 1950s when there was still a mummy trade operating .  According to Kettler , ` unwrapping parties ' - where a genuine mummy is unwrapped and the trinkets inside handed out - were not uncommon in Germany at the time .  The sarcophagus was found alongside a death mask and a canopic jar - used to store organs extracted from the deceased - but these were quickly outed as fake .  Kettler insisted on having the corpse itself tested though , intrigued at the possibility of it being real , despite some pointing out that the body was bound in 20th century cloth .  The mummification process dates back to 3,500 BC with the oldest intact Egyptian mummy dating from 100 years after that .  The mummy , known simply as ID # 32751 , is currently held by the British Museum .  It was apparently preserved by direct contact with the dry desert sand , though it is uncertain whether the mummification was intended .  The only mystery that now remains is why somebody would store a fake mummy in their attic for four decades .  Tradition : Ancient Egyptians used to mummify both humans and animals when they died  Ancient Egyptians were firm believers in the afterlife when someone died .  But they thought to get there , the body needed to be recognisable , so that the dead person could repossess it .  The chief embalmer was a priest wearing the mask of Anubis - the jackal-headed God of the dead .  First the brains would be pulled out of the person through the nose using a hook .  Then all the internal organs would removed , including the lungs , stomach , intestines and liver and placed in jars . The heart would be replaced .  The inside of the body would be rinsed with wine and spices before being covered with salt for 70 days .  After 40 days it would be stuffed with linen to give it a more humane shape .  At 70 days it would be wrapped in bandages and placed inside a brightly-painted coffin .  Mainly wealthy people were mummified because poorer people could not afford it .  Animals were also sometimes mummified as gestures to the Gods or so that they could accompany their owners in the afterlife . \n",

            "By Matt Chorley , Mailonline Political Editor  Tony Blair has used secret talks to urge Michael Gove to face down opposition to his radical education reforms .  The former Labour Prime Minister has held at least two meetings in recent months with the Conservative Education Secretary urging him to press ahead in the face of criticism , including from the Labour party .  The private support from such a surprising quarter has emboldened the Tory minister to go further in his plans to overhaul the English education system . Mr Blair has also privately dismissed Ed Miliband 's current education strategy as ` bunkum ' .  Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove has been buoyed by the support of ex-Labour PM Tony Blair  The disclosure of an alliance between the two men is likely to provoke deep unease in today 's Labour party , which has sought to turn Mr Gove into public enemy number one .  While Mr Gove has previously confessed to being a Blairite , it will prove highly controversial for Mr Miliband that his predecessor is offering advice to the Tories .  To add to the division Mr Blair has previously dismissed Labour 's current education policy of ` standards not structures ' as empty rhetoric which failed to deliver results when he was in power .  Mr Blair is known to be an ardent supporter of Mr Gove 's academies programme , freeing schools from local authority control .  Bunkum : Labour 's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has said his policy is focused on ` standards not structures ' - something Mr Blair has dismissed as pointless rhetoric  He has also hailed free schools as a ` great idea ' and accused the teaching unions of standing against ` necessary educational change ' .  By contrast Tristram Hunt , the current shadow education secretary in Mr Miliband 's team , has condemned much of what Mr Gove is doing .  Last week in a Commons debate Mr Hunt insisted : ` The first plank in Labour 's schools policy is to focus on standards and not structures .  ` We do not think that the job is done simply because a school has changed its name to that of an academy or a free school .  ` We think that the most important relationship is between a teacher and a pupil , and we would therefore ensure that all teachers in state-funded schools were qualified or working towards qualified teacher status . '  But Mr Blair has already rubbished the ` standards not structures ' mantra as a good soundbite which ignores the need for better structures to improve standards .  Writing in his 2010 autobiography A Journey , Mr Blair wrote : ` We had come to power in 1997 saying it was `` standards not structures '' that mattered .  ` This was fine as a piece of rhetoric ; and positively beneficial as a piece of politics . Unfortunately , as I began to realise when experience started to shape our thinking , it was bunkum as a piece of policy . The whole point is that structures beget standards . How service is configured affects outcomes . '  In a major speech yesterday Mr Gove set out plans to raise standards in state schools so they become indistinguishable from private schools .  He suggested that a London state school Thomas Jones primary school in West London - where most children are brought up with English as a foreign language - offers a better education than the private Wetherby School attended by Princes William and Harry just around the corner .  Mr Gove used a speech yesterday to set out plans to break down the ` Berlin wall ' between state and private schools  Labour 's education spokesman Tristram Hunt : ` The first plank in Labour 's schools policy is to focus on standards and not structures . We think that the most important relationship is between a teacher and a pupil , and we would therefore ensure that all teachers in state-funded schools were qualified or working towards qualified teacher status . ' January 2014  Former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair : ` We had come to power in 1997 saying it was `` standards not structures '' that mattered ... This was fine as a piece of rhetoric ; and positively beneficial as a piece of politics . Unfortunately , as I began to realise when experience started to shape our thinking , it was bunkum as a piece of policy . ` September 2010  Mr Gove vowed to ` break down the Berlin wall ' between state and private schools to drive up standards .  He proposed state schools checking 13-year-olds ' progress by making them sit the Common Entrance exam , which is used by leading private schools to select pupils .  The school day could be lengthened to up to 10 hours to improve academic performance and offer more activities including cadets , choir and sport .  And he urged a return to old-fashioned discipline , including writing lines , sweeping up and removing graffiti .  But once again Mr Hunt 's response to the wide-ranging speech focussed on Labour 's policy that every teacher should be qualified and registered .  He said : ` Improving school standards starts with a qualified teacher in every classroom . Until Michael Gove commits to this , he is ruling himself out of any serious debate about how we raise standards in our schools . '  A source close to Mr Gove : ` Hunt is turning out to be a one-trick pony . He 's got nothing to say on the longer school day , discipline or rigour .  ` Instead he trots out the same hypocritical policy on teacher qualifications that would deny ordinary kids at state school the top class education he enjoyed . '  Mr Gove is not the only Conservative member of the Government linked to Mr Blair . George Osborne , the Chancellor , was reported to have referred to Mr Blair as ` the master ' and used his memoir as a reference book for reform . \n",

Tommy Robinson , 30 , the leader of the far-right group , allegedly wanted to defy a police ban by marching past a mosque to Woolwich Barracks in southeast London .  The EDL supremo - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - and his deputy Kevin Carroll , 44 , were arrested when they tried to enter the borough of Tower Hamlets on June 29 .  Charged : English Defence League leaders Kevin Carroll , left , and Tommy Robinson are accused of obstructing police by trying to defy a ban on marching to the scene of Fusilier Lee Rigby 's murder via the East London Mosque on June 29  Denial : Both men , who appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court today , denied a single charge of obstructing a police officer at the march  Upcoming trial : Tommy Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - and Deputy Leader Kevin Carroll , right , will go on trial next month  The pair are accused of deviating from a specific route laid down by the police which prevented them from entering the borough .  Robinson and Carroll appeared together in the dock today at Westminster Magistrates Court .  Carroll entered a not guilty plea to the single charge of obstructing a police officer , while Robinson had denied the charge at an earlier hearing .  The two men claim they were on a charity walk that day , culminating with the laying of flowers in Woolwich where Drummer Rigby was killed .

They argue they were on a sponsored walk to Woolwich Barracks where they were planning to lay flowers in memory of Drummer Rigby .  The Met Police say they had offered two alternative routes for the walk which avoided Tower Hamlets , home to the East London Mosque , and had warned that anyone who tried to march to Woolwich would face arrest .

Jasmine Nassif , who had been out celebrating her 21st birthday , was one of a gang which attacked four clubbers , including on-leave British squaddie Alfred Kyei-Baffour outside London 's Guildhall .  The attackers had taken offence after one of the other party started chatting up girls in their group .  The violence was captured on CCTV and showed Mr Kyei-Baffour and his friends being chased by at least ten people while being punched and kicked before a baseball bat appears and is used to hit on their the heads and body .  During the melee the British Army squaddie was stabbed twice causing deep wounds and his ` intestines to hang out ' leaving him with life threatening injuries last July . He has made a recovery and has returned to his regiment .  Although no-one was convicted of the stabbing , seven people in court today , including Nassif , who had spurred the gang on , were jailed for violent disorder .  Mr Kyei-Baffour 's party had been to one club and were returning to their car when they came across crowds outside another club closing opposite Wood Street police station .  Jasmine Nassif who had been celebrating her 21st birthday ` took offence ' when one of Mr Kyei-Baffour 's party started chatting up some girls but police quickly separated the two sides .  Mr Kyei-Baffour and his party returned to their car while Nassif 's group waited for two cabs . But as Nassif and her boyfriend Ishmael Francis , 22 , headed towards their own car they came across Mr Kyei-Baffour and his friends in their BMW and another row erupted .  Scroll down for video :  Savage : CCTV image shows a gang member -LRB- right -RRB- , holding a baseball bat and running at Mr Kyei-Baffour , 21 , who is standing at the rear of the car outside The Guildhall in London . The soldier was later stabbed twice  Threats : The man and Nassif , -LRB- in pink -RRB- approach the car as the victim stands by the door . He would later need life saving treatment  Francis then flagged down the cabs and they were joined by eight or nine of their friends who attacked the four with fists and feet . Nassif was seen to stride into the fray and egged the others on before sprinting to the boot of her car with Francis .  Judge Wendy Joseph QC said : ` Immediately she was joined by Francis who seconds later ran to the fight now armed with a baseball bat .  ` That bat then to some extent superseded the physical violence that was taking place without weapons . There was some pushing , punches and kicking but the bat took central stage .  Jailed : Nassif -LRB- left -RRB- - who wept in court during the trial - was criticised by the judge for egging on the gang . She was sentenced to two years in prison . Her boyfriend Francis -LRB- right -RRB- was jailed for 22 months  ` It was used with extreme violence , it was directed certainly by some at the head and bodies of more than one person from the BMW . The scene was described as chaos and mayhem . '  She added in the course of the incident Mr Kyei-Baffour ` suffered two deep wounds the injuries , one that left the intestines hanging out . '  The prosecution could not say who stabbed Mr Kyei-Baffour , a Ghanaian serving in the Royal Logistics Corps , and causing GBH charges were dropped during the trial .  Judge Joseph told them none were to be sentenced ` for inflicting or participating in inflicting these wounds .  ` The violent disorder of itself is not , in light of the Crown 's putting its case , to be treated as involving the stabbing .  Thugs : Marlon Brown -LRB- left -RRB- and Leonel Streete -LRB- right -RRB- were both sentenced to two years in prison for there part in the brutal attack  Prison : Rowan Lopez , 25 , -LRB- left -RRB- was sentenced to 18 months in jail , while fellow gang member Riquelle Peterson , 24 , -LRB- right -RRB- was sentenced to two years in prison  But each of these defendants by participating in such violent disorder as they did , played in part in the scene against which the stabbing occurred . Without their group conduct , I am quite satisfied this stabbing would not have occurred . '  Nassif , of Alma Road Enfield who has convictions for robbery , assault and threatening behaviour when she was aged 15 and 16 , was sentenced to two years behind bars .  Judge Joseph said : ' I am satisfied she was striding into the crowd egging and encouraging it from the beginning and played a part in the bat being produced from the boot of the car .  ` It was her verbal aggression that caused the initial confrontation . She has wept her way through this trial presenting a pitiful spectacle . '  Francis , of of Hadrians Ride , Enfield , who has a convictions for knife possession was jailed for 22 months .  Sentenced : Colin Mbagwu , 27 , -LRB- left -RRB- was jailed for 27 months for his part in the attack . Streete , -LRB- right -RRB- was pictured grinning as he left court during the trial . He was later jailed  Marlon Brown , 27 , of Tottenham ; Leonel Streete , 23 , of Wood Green , and Riquelle Peterson , 24 , of Holloway ; were jailed for two years each while Colin Mbagwu , 27 of Hornsey was jailed for 27 months and Rowan Lopez , 25 , of Muswell Hill was jailed for 18 months .  Mr Kyei-Baffour has since recovered and returned to active service .  Commander Wayne Chance of City of London Police said : ` We will not tolerate this kind of violent behaviour in the City of London . I am pleased that the officers in the case were able to bring it to a swift and satisfying conclusion and would like to highlight the good work done in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police .  ` Anyone coming to the City of London with the intention of being violent should know that they will be dealt with so that those wishing to enjoy the vibrant nightlife in the City can do so without fear . ` DS John Ellis , who led the investigation said : ' I hope the sentences passed will act a deterrent to those involved .

            "A woman was secretly filmed carrying buckets and bags of hay while she pocketed more than # 3,000 in disability benefits having claimed she could barely walk .  Carmen Smith , 46 , was caught during a survillance operation on the moors last year lugging the objects in heavy snow and freezing temperatures before sorting horse feed .  Smith had initially claimed a disability living allowance legitimately as she said she was virtually unable to walk . She had told authorities she needed help with her personal care and could not move around without help  Scroll down for video  Carmen Smith was caught on camera carrying buckets and bags of hay while over-claiming more than # 3,000 in disability allowances  Smith was caught during a survillance operation lugging the items in heavy snow and freezing conditions  But the Teesside Crown Court heard Smith never told authorities when her health improved , meaning she was payed # 3,227 in benefits she was n't entitled to .  Prosecutor Jonathan Walker said : ` When her mobility and ability to function improved , she was under a legal duty to inform the department .  ` There had been a significant improvement . '  Smith told investigators she did not think her condition had improved that much and that she was suffering terribly from depression and could not do anything without painkillers .  Smith , of Moorsholm , East Cleveland , admitted one charge of failing to promptly notify the Department for Work and Pensions of a change in her circumstances .  Peter Sabiston , defending , said Smith 's ` improvement was somewhat transitory ' .  He said : ` There was a period of improvement . It was relatively gradual . It was assisted by drugs .  Smith 's lawyer said his client 's health had improved gradually and she was ` assisted by drugs ' , but on reflection she realised she should of alerted authorities to her change in circumstances  ` When confronted with the CCTV she realised upon reflection she should have reported it to the Department for Work and Pensions .  ` She 's lost her good character , something she 'll never get back . '  Mr Sabiston said Smith 's financial and personal circumstances weighed heavily on her , and she now had to deal with her mother 's diagnosis with cancer .  Judge Peter Bowers told Smith : ' I accept that this claim started off completely genuine .  ` Over time with treatment your health did improve , but you continued to claim disability living allowance .  ` The amount that you were overpaid will be eventually recovered by the department . '  Bearing in mind her personal circumstances , the judge gave Smith a one-year supervision order , saying she needed the Probation Service 's help and guidance .   \n",

Nye , who used to teach science to kids on his 1990s television program , argued that the scientific community was in agreement that man-made factors are accelerating climate change .  But Blackburn , a Republican who represents Tennessee , says there is no such consensus and that climate change is ` unproven ' . And laws , Blackburn argued , should n't be based on ` unproven hypotheses ' .  Heated : Bill Nye the ` Science Guy ' -LRB- left -RRB- debated U.S. Representative Marsha Blackburn , Republican - Tennessee -LRB- right -RRB- , on the issue of climate change on Meet the Press Sunday  Blackburn said even if climate change was real , it would n't matter what the U.S. did about it since it would n't change the problem on a global level .  Nye tried to change the conversation to facts , holding up an iPad showing how much the Arctic Circle has shrunk in recent years .  ` Once again , the congresswoman is trying to introduce doubt in the whole idea of climate change , ' Nye said . ` What I would just encourage everybody to do is , let 's back up and look at the facts .  Evidence : Nye used an iPad to show how the Arctic Circle has retreated in recent years in an attempt to convince Blackburn that global warming is real  The science teacher : Nye became famous in the 1990s for hosting a TV show which taught science to children  ` You are a leader . We need you to change things , not to deny what 's happening , ' Nye added .  Nye did seem to win the debate when host David Gregory stepped in and said states are beginning to feel the economic consequences of climate change , including the historic drought in California .  This is n't the first time that Nye has taken to being a voice in the scientific community .  He recently debated a creationist about evolution .  At the debate held at the Creation Museum in Petersburg , Kentucky , Nye argued that evolution should be universally taught in classrooms in order to keep the U.S. a leader in innovation .  ` If we continue to eschew science ... we are not going to move forward , ' Nye said at the debate earlier this month . ` We will not embrace natural laws . We will not make discoveries . We will not invent and innovate and stay ahead . '  Speaking out : Nye recently debated a creationist over evolution \n",

            "PUBLISHED :  06:16 EST , 11 April 2013   |  UPDATED :  20:27 EST , 11 April 2013  A year and a half ago Kerry Maletroit was so ill that she was unable to move or breathe for herself . With just 12 per cent lung capacity , she was in constant , excruciating pain and doctors had warned her she may not survive much longer .  But now the Jersey born 30-year-old is fighting fit , saying she has never felt better and that she enjoys dancing the night away and taking her dog , Disney , for a walk on the beach .  This dramatic turnaround is all thanks to the double lung transplant that Kerry underwent in November 2011 .  Kerry with her husband Philip and pet dog , Disney , just six months after her transplant  She is just one of thousands of Britons who have benefited from the 50 per cent increase in organ donation over the past five years , according to new figures released by NHS Blood and Transplant -LRB- NHSBT -RRB- .  There are currently 7,300 patients on the transplant waiting list and 6,000 of those are waiting for new kidneys .  Nearly every donor can provide at least one kidney and usually they will be able to provide two . Each day three Britons die waiting for an organ .  Kerry suffers with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome , a genetic condition that affects collagen production . It causes tissue , blood vessels and joints in the body to be stretchy and fragile .  For most people , the condition is n't life-threatening , but if teamed with other conditions , symptoms can be more serious .  Kerry suffered with asthma as a child and suffered bouts of pneumonia as a teenager which severely damaged her already fragile lung tissue .  Fragile : Kerry pictured six months before her double lung transplant  Road to recovery : Kerry pictured nine weeks after her organ transplant  ` The last bout was when I was 18 and I was left very wheezy , ' says Kerry , a former administrator . ` I found exercise harder than most but I was able to function and with an asthma pump . Life was pretty normal . '  However , over the course of her twenties , Kerry 's health deteriorated rapidly . Doctors regularly tested her lung function and tried to manage her breathlessness but they were unable to stop the steady decline in her ability to breathe .  ` It was terrible -- imagine pinching your nose and breathing through a straw , ' says Kerry . ` That was how life was , day in , day out . It is really terrifying because your body is starved of oxygen and there 's nothing you can do . '  As her body became increasingly weak , she became prone to infection and developed severe and debilitating panic attacks that left her frightened to leave her house .  The couple married before Kerry 's transplant because they were unsure of what the outcome would be  As Kerry -LRB- pictured with husband Philip -RRB- became more ill , her weight plummeted to just over five stone  Her skin turned an ashen grey , her weight plummeted to just over five stone and she was eventually fed intravenously in a desperate bid to get her to put on weight so she could grow new lung tissue .  ` I was so weak I had to catch a bus to work even though it was only a 15 minute walk away , ' she says . ` Eventually it got to the point where I could n't even brush my teeth without getting out of breath . '  By age 25 , doctors were keen for Kerry to have a transplant , although she was reluctant to have such a major operation , admitting she was in denial about her grave situation : ` You never imagine it will be you and , at the time , I could n't quite cope with the situation . It was entirely overwhelming . '  In July 2010 Kerry was put on the organ donor list but had to wait a further 16 months until a suitable pair of lungs -- one that matched her size and blood type -- came up . During this time she became critically ill .  Throughout this period , she hospitalised at the Royal Brompton Hospital in north west London .  Finally she was placed permanently in intensive care because she repeatedly went into full respiratory arrest and could not breathe without the aid of a lung bypass machine .  ` Doctors told my family they were not sure how long I would last so my husband Philip called my family and they flew over from Jersey to spend as much time as possible with me before time ran out , ' she says .  ` But by the end of their visit I went into such a severe respiratory arrest I was sedated and put in an artificial coma . '  Miraculously , during this time a pair of donor lungs that matched Kerry 's criteria came up and a week later Kerry woke up with new lungs .  New lease of life : Kerry with husband Philip before her operation -LRB- left -RRB- and after , as a bridesmaid in 2012 -LRB- right -RRB-  ` My family were so frightened that I might give up the fight that as I slowly came round they kept whispering in my ear `` Kerry , you 've got new lungs . It 's all going to be okay , you 're going to get better ! '' , ' she remembers . ` I was very confused because I was on so many drugs but I could hear them . '  Within hours of the transplant at the Harefield Hospital , Kerry 's family were astonished by the visible difference in her health . She was still incredibly weak but they could n't help but be shocked by her suddenly rosy cheeks .  ` It took me two days until I could even touch my nose because I was so exhausted , but within three weeks I was taken off a ventilator and able to breathe for myself , ' explains Kerry .  ` I could n't believe I 'd made it -- I was ecstatic . '  Kerry has n't met her donor 's family but she knows that her lungs came from a 47-year-old female .  She has written to the family and says that every day is a reminder of how she is indebted to the anonymous woman who took the time to put herself on the register .  ` My lung function is now 90 per cent and I appreciate every single moment , every single thing . I just want to do the woman who helped me proud . I want to make sure I make the most of the extra time I 've been given . '  Kerry continues to take anti-rejection drugs , steroids and a number of other medications to ensure her new lungs function properly for as long as possible .  She says she is optimistic about the future .  ` I can honestly say I 've never felt better in my life -- I 've booked a holiday to Australia with my husband and I 've even applied for a job . Normal life has never felt so good . '  To register for organ donation visit NHSBT Donation  To read more about Kerry 's story visit her blog Transplant Tales  The sharp rise in organ donation is largely due to the creation of a network of specialist nurses who support bereaved families and discuss the possibility of organ donation with them .  Specialist nurses are one of a number of recommendations made in 2008 by the Organ Donation Taskforce , following a decade of almost no increase in the number of donated organs .  The taskforce also pushed for the creation of specialist organ retrieval teams and wider promotion and campaigning around the importance of organ donation .  Giving and taking : The number of organs being donated is at an all time high  These recommendations have led to a sharp increase in organ donors across the UK -- a rise of 49 per cent rise in England , of 16 per cent in Wales , of 74 per cent increase in Scotland and an astounding 82 per cent increase in Northern Ireland .  Consequently there has been a 31 per cent boost in the number of people receiving a life-saving or enhancing organ transplant since 2008 .  ` This is an outstanding achievement that few thought possible at the time this ambition was set , ' said Bill Fullagar , chairman of NHSBT . ` It is the result of the hard work and dedication of staff in hospitals and communities across the country .  ` We must also share our heartfelt thanks with every family who , at a great time of sadness , supported their loves one 's wish to donate their organs and transform the lives of up to nine other people . '  Despite the increase in organ donors , the numbers of families refusing to grant consent remains among the highest in Europe , and NHSBT is calling for more to be done .  In addition to this , lack of organ donation awareness amongst the black and Asian community particularly needs to targeted , according to the NHSBT .  Despite being three times more likely to need a transplant , only three per cent of this section of the population is on the organ donation register . \n",

            "As people across Australia relaxed after a day of festive over indulgence , one man was enduring perhaps the most miserable Christmas Day ever after becoming stranded on his jetski in the middle of a lake .  The 28-year-old experienced jetskier had set off for a simple 4.5 km ride on Lake Hume on the Victorian/New South Wales border , near his hometown of Albury , when his Christmas day went drastically wrong .  The man 's friends become worried and reported him missing to police after he failed to return from the 15-minute ride by 8.00 pm after setting off at 6.30 pm .

After being spotted by his friends , Lake Hume Coast Guard set out to retrieve him and his jet ski .  Lake Hume Coast Guard Deputy Commander , Kevin Ellison , told Daily Mail Australia : ` He was found this morning and he was reasonably well ... He 'd been out in the cold all night .

However , he fled to Syria to fight alongside the Kurdish forces after becoming ` horrified by the atrocities being carried out by ISIS ' .  Mr Scurfield 's body was flown to Manchester last week because the People 's Protection Unit -LRB- YPG -RRB- , who he was fighting alongside , has a large base in the city .

            "Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne looked to have scored the catch of the day as the smiling star netted two huge fish during an outing with a friend .  The troubled star , who was treated in hospital last month after he was found staggering in the street during an alcoholic relapse , looked in better health than a few weeks ago , and beamed as he reeled in the trout .  However , he did appear to be toasting his success on the water with a lager , apparently sipping from a can of Stella Artois beer on the banks of the lake at the Rockbourne trout fishery near Fordingbridge , Hampshire .  Scroll down for video  Catch of the day : Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne netted two huge fish during an outing with a friend  Time for a drink : The star appeared to be toasting his success on the water with a lager , apparently sipping from a can of Stella Artois beer on the banks of the lake at the Rockbourne trout fishery  Day out : The troubled star , who was treated in hospital last month after he was found staggering in the street during an alcoholic relapse , looked in better health than a few weeks ago  Fellow fishermen said he had pulled the can from a blue bag bearing the slogan ` Keep Calm And Carry ' , but had just stuck to one beer , and appeared to be sober .  The midfielder , whose career included stints at Tottenham Hotspur , Glasgow Rangers and Lazio , chatted with fellow anglers , and posed of for pictures with his haul , giving one of the trout a kiss .  ` It was great to see him healthier and happier than recently . He was smiling and really seemed to be enjoying himself , ' one fisherman told the Daily Mirror .  He added : ' I only ever saw him drinking from one can and he seemed happy and sober . '  In August , Gascoigne was taken to hospital after he was pictured clutching a bottle of gin in the street near his rented apartment in Sandbanks , Poole .  Success : The beaming midfielder seemed happy with his catch , posing up with his haul and giving one of the trout a kiss  He was also seen wandering the streets outside his expensive apartment block , holding a carrier bag full of cans of Stella Artois , and sitting with his head in his hands .  Neighbours called 999 for help after finding the midfielder slumped against a wall , and an ambulance arrived to take the former England star to hospital .  After pictures emerged showing Gascoigne looking much older than 47 , looking gaunt with sunken eyes , QPR manager Harry Redknapp , who also lives Sandbanks , offered him the chance to work alongside him in football .

I 'd love it if he could do that . It 's an open invitation .  ` He 's a great lad and it 's sad to see what 's happened to him and how he 's looking at the moment . '  In a TV documentary shown last September , Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again , despite knowing it could kill him .  He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson , having found been unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky .  Good spirits : Fellow anglers said Gascoigne had seemed ` healthier and happier ' as he enjoyed his fishing trip  Afficionado : Gascoigne has long been known for his love of fishing  Since then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs , particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago .  Earlier this month , he was seen crashing a golf buggy into a ditch after losing control of the 15mpg vehicle at the Playgolf course in Bournemouth .  He was said to be dazed but unhurt after the incident .  Days later he was photographed cradling a chicken at a pub in Hampshire , and the next day apparently being turned away from an off-licence in Poole .  Struggle : Gascoigne has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs , particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago  Past activities : Earlier this month , Gascoigne was seen crashing a golf buggy into a ditch after losing control of the 15mpg vehicle at the Playgolf course in Bournemouth  Treatment : For the past four years , Gascoigne , pictured with his fishing flies , has been living in Poole , where he is an occasional patient at the nearby Providence Project rehabilitation centre  For the past four years , Gascoigne has been living in Poole , where he is an occasional patient at the nearby Providence Project rehabilitation centre , but was reportedly due to be evicted from his penthouse flat earlier this month after a string of disturbances .  The director of the management company in charge of the flats has dismissed claims he is being forced to leave , but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract .  On September 10 , he was arrested for allegedly throwing a brick at a van outside his home in Sandbanks and questioned on suspicion of criminal damage . It is believed it followed an altercation with a photographer .  He was released on bail until October pending further enquiries  In 2010 , he called a radio station to inform them he was off to search for fugitive Raoul Moat while he was hiding from police officers , taking with him a fishing rod , lager and some chicken .  Done fishin ' : Gascoigne poses with one of his trout while sitting on a ride-on mower at the fishery  On the move : Gascoigne tests out a small truck at the New Forest fishing lake  He later admitted he did not realise that the former bouncer had shot a police officer in the face and admitted he feels ` guilty ' about the incident .  Moat died following a stand-off with police . Gascoigne said in a radio interview at the time : ` He is willing to give in now . I just want to give him some therapy and say `` come on Moaty , it 's Gazza . '' '  He later told the Daily Express : ' I thought I could take him fishing because stuff like that has worked on me . But his situation was different from mine . '  In a TV documentary shown last September , Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again , despite knowing it could kill him .  He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson , having been found unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky .  Since then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs , particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago .  Last year his friends DJ Chris Evans and ex-England cricketer Ronnie Irani paid for Gascoigne to attend a rehab clinic in Arizona .  Hunter Davies , who co-wrote the former star 's 2004 autobiography , said : ` He does n't even like alcohol . He hates the taste of it .  ` I 've been with him when he 's poured it into flower pots , because he finds it so revolting . But then he will get depressed , and just want to get obliterated . '  Despite his demons , he is still remembered fondly by fans of the clubs he played for - including Newcastle United , Lazio , Rangers , Everton and Middlesbrough - for his brilliance on the pitch .  He starred in midfield for Terry Venables ' England side during Euro 96 , where his virtuoso goal against Scotland was topped off with an equally memorable celebration .  Six years earlier he was seen crying on the pitch after being booked in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup against West Germany . The booking making him unable to play in the final . \n",

            "Ed Miliband is under pressure to use his conference next week to present Labour as a credible alternative government  Ed Miliband is today warned by a string of senior Labour figures that he needs to up his game and spell out why and how he thinks he can be Prime Minister .  Ahead of his party 's annual conference this weekend , Mr Miliband is also warned that London Mayor Boris Johnson could be his rival as Tory leader by 2015 .  There is growing unease that after two years in charge , the Labour leader has failed to present his party as a credible government in waiting .  Alan Johnson , who Mr Miliband chose as shadow chancellor , today bluntly warns Mr Miliband has not done enough to prove he is up to the job .  ` Whilst I personally do n't believe that a prime minister who is more popular than his party can deliver an election victory , it does suggest that Ed Miliband has to do more to demonstrate that he is a leader , ' Mr Johnson wrote in The Guardian .  In part due this is due to the ` age-old problem of opposition parties who struggle to make the news and a leader who has never been tested in the difficult job he aspires to ' , Mr Johnson added /  Meanwhile Douglas Alexander , the shadow foreign secretary , admitted Labour are still the ` underdogs of British politics ' despite being ahead in the polls .  Mr Alexander , who ran David Miliband 's leadership campaign , said the party needed to wake up to the threat posed by Boris Johnson .  ` I think it 's time that we take Boris seriously , ' he told the New Statesman .  Labour 's shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said his party had to start taking Boris Johnson -LRB- above -RRB- seriously  Mr Alexander added : ` It is not yet a probability but it is a possibility that -LSB- Boris -RSB- will lead the Conservative Party into the next general election .  ` He 's managed to put a smile on voters ' faces quite regularly . People feel he does n't play by the rules and does n't conform to type . '  In a survey this month , Mr Johnson was named Britain 's most respected politician with a ` net respect ' rating of +25 points .  Former Labour Home Secretary Alan Johnson today warned Ed Miliband had to prove he is up to the job of being leader  Ed Miliband was on -29 , well below David Cameron 's -18 points .  In what has been seen as a challenge to Mr Miliband 's authority , Harriet Harman told the Spectator that she wants to be the second most powerful figure in a Labour government .  The deputy leader told The Spectator : ` It is my ambition to be deputy prime minister when we are next in government . Unfinished business . '  Mr Miliband 's relationship with the unions will also be thrown into the spotlight next week , when the party conference is urged to condemn the public sector pay freeze which the leadership has said it supports .  The Tories have identified Labour reliance on union funding as a key weakness of Mr Miliband 's leadership .  Ed Balls , the shadow chancellor , was heckled at this month 's TUC Congress when he said that pay was not the first priority when jobs were being lost under the Government 's spending cuts .  Unison has submitted a motion to Labour 's annual gathering in Manchester which attacks the public sector pay freeze and complains that a # 250 increase for lower paid workers , announced by Chancellor George Osborne , had only been paid to a minority of employees .  It reads : ` Conference condemns the prolonged pay freezes that mean public sector workers have had their real terms pay cut dramatically and notes that most of the lowest paid have not received the # 250 rise that Osborne promised .  ` Conference believes that depressing workers ' living standards in a recession is self-defeating and contributes to economic stagnation .

            "By Matt Blake  PUBLISHED :  06:21 EST , 19 March 2013   |  UPDATED :  14:40 EST , 19 March 2013  A 19-year-old American musician has been jailed for at least five years after being convicted of murdering an Irish exchange student in Japan .  US musician Richard Hinds , 19 , from Memphis , Tennessee , was said to have drugged 21-year-old Nicola Furlong in a bar after meeting her and a friend as they returned from a Nicki Minaj concert in Tokyo .  He and a friend , who was also American , then took the unconscious girls back to the Keio Plaza hotel in the city 's Shinjuku district in wheelchairs where they sexually assaulted them .  But their plan was scuppered when Nicola awoke from her stupor , at which point Hinds strangled the exchange student with a towel or tank top to cover her cries for help , the court heard .  Following the sentencing today , Nicola 's mother Angela today reacted angrily , declaring : ` Nicola 's life was worth more than that . '  Scroll down for video  Jailed : US musician Richard Hinds , left , 19 , from Memphis , Tennessee , was said to have strangled Nicola Furlong , right , when she awoke as he sexually assaulted her in a hotel room  She added : ` It 's good that they -LRB- judges -RRB- cleared her name . Nicola has done nothing wrong . It was all him and his lies that brought us out here .  ` We still do n't know the truth of what happened in that room but we know Nicola did nothing wrong , we knew that coming out anyway . '  Hinds was on trial as a minor . The death penalty was not an option for judges and possible sentence was limited to up to 10 years .  Nicola 's father Brendan said the family had been made aware that possible sentences were limited .  Popular : Nicola -LRB- left , centre -RRB- and her friend -LRB- not pictured -RRB- , who is also Irish but whose name was withheld in court , went to the city to see a concert by US rapper Nicki Minaj -LRB- right -RRB-  Family in grief : Andrew Furlong , left , his wife , Angela , right , and their daughter , Andrea , leave Tokyo District Court in Tokyo today  ` When we found out he was on trial as a minor we knew it was not going to be a hanging , ' he said .  Hinds stood silently as he was found guilty of strangling the student in what the presiding judge called a ` vicious ' attack .  His evidence was also described as at times not credible and irrational .  The court ruled that Hinds had tried to taint Nicola 's memory and that he had shown no remorse .  Hinds and another American were accused of taking Nicola , 21 , and one of her friends to the hotel after they had passed out in a bar .  The Tokyo District Court ruled that Hinds strangled Nicola to keep her quiet when she regained consciousness in his hotel room .  A second American man , James Blackston , a 23-year-old dancer from Los Angeles , was seen with Hinds bringing Nicola and her unnamed friend unconscious into the hotel on CCTV footage which was played to the court .  He was convicted last week of sexually assaulting the second girl and sentenced to three years in jail .  Nicola 's sister Andrea said she felt let down by the Japanese criminal justice system .  ` I 'm absolutely disgusted and so angry and so hurt , ' she said .  Grief : Mr Furlong said the family was at least glad they managed to clear Nicola 's name in court  With friends : After the concert , Nicola -LRB- top , second left -RRB- and her unnamed friend met Hinds and Blackston and went with them to a bar where both of the women passed out . Prosecutors suggested they were drugged  ` We had so much faith in the Japanese doing justice for us and I do n't feel we got it . '  Nicola had been studying and living about 62 miles -LRB- 100km -RRB- north of Tokyo , at Takasaki City University of Economics as part of an exchange programme .  According to evidence in both trials , Nicola and her friend , who is also Irish but whose name was withheld in court , went to the city to see a concert by US rapper Nicki Minaj .  After the concert , the two met Hinds and Blackston and went with them to a bar . At some point both of the women passed out . Prosecutors suggested they were drugged .  Security camera footage presented as evidence showed Blackston sexually assaulting Nicola 's friend in a taxi on the way to the hotel , where the men borrowed wheelchairs to get the unconscious women to the rooms .  Let down : Nicola , right , with her sister Andrea who said she felt ` let down ' by the Japanese justice system  Fun times : Nicola poses with friends at a Japanese theme park  Prosecutors claimed Hinds strangled Nicola , a Dublin City University student from Curracloe , Co Wexford , with a towel to keep her quiet after she regained consciousness .  The defence , in an attempt to explain the girls ' unconscious state , claimed that they had been drinking excessively .  In evidence Nicolas unnamed friend said she could not remember anything after taking a drink given to her during the evening .  Nicola 's mother said their belief in their daughter never wavered .  ` It never faltered with us . We knew what type of little girl Nicola is . She always will be a very special little girl to us , ' she said outside the court in Tokyo .  ` She 's not what that person -LRB- Hinds -RRB- tried to make her out to be . The whole nation , the whole world can see that now . '  Spiked ? In evidence Nicola 's unnamed friend said she could not remember anything after taking a drink given to her during the evening . Here Nicola is pictured in a Japanese pool hall , left , and with brother Danny , right  Mr Furlong said : ` There was n't anything we agreed with the defence , but then we are biased with Nicola . But the way they tried to paint her , not a hope in hell was she like that .  ` All her friends and anyone who knew her , and I hope anyone that did n't know her , can see she was not anything like they were trying to make out .  ` We got her name cleared .  ' I do n't want to ever hear his -LRB- Hinds ' -RRB- name mentioned again . I 've no interest in him whatsoever . '  The family said they expected to feel a sense of emptiness on returning home to Ireland after a nine-month quest for justice .  Mr Furlong added : ` That 's probably our start of grieving for Nicola , and she can rest in peace , hopefully she is , please God . '  Hinds denied the charges against him .  During his evidence he admitted lightly pressing on the 21-year-old 's neck in the hotel room but denied killing her intentionally .  Hinds was 19 and a minor under Japanese law when he was arrested , but was being tried in an adult court .  Although murder in Japan can carry the death penalty , prosecutors sought a maximum jail sentence of 10 years . \n",

            "By Katy Winter  The woman behind the looks that have captivated the world in Beyonce 's latest string of videos has opened up about working with Queen Bey and the tricks she uses to keep Mrs Carter looking on top form .  Makeup artist Francesca Tolot , a legend in the industry , met Beyonce in 2003 when she created that sexy ` wet look ' for her smash hit Crazy In Love . Since then the two have been near-inseparable professionally .  Speaking to Into The Gloss , Francesca has nothing but praise for the singer , and says that , despite the her monumental fame , there was no awkwardness when they met .  Scroll down for video  Filming ` Partition ' for her new album : Francesca says the pair worked closely together to create the looks for each video  The secret to Beyonce 's dewy , glowing skin ? It 's down to baby oil , says her makeup artist  ` She was very nice ; she 's a very approachable and warm person . We hit it off from the beginning . Right away I felt very comfortable , and very appreciated , too , because she loved everything we did . '  Francesco reveals that the key to Mrs Carter 's incredible glow on stage and camera is in fact just good old baby oil - a huge plus for those who do n't have a Beyonce-sized makeup budget .  Francesca says the two work closely together to create her looks - opting for a much more pared-down , natural look for many of the videos for her new album .  Francesca and Beyonce have worked together for over 10 years , creating some of her most iconic looks and seeing her rise to super stardom  Her hardest task while working for the star was making her look unattractive for a scene in her film Cadillac Records in which she strared as Etta James -LRB- pictured -RRB-  Beyonce 's natural beauty means she does n't need that much make-up , says Francesca  She says : ` There is n't really a look she does n't like . She 's very smart -- whatever we do is her project . It 's her .  ` We stopped using lashes quite a few years ago , except for that look in the `` Blow '' video , when we went for a really ` 70s look . At one point I brought up the fact that I feel that false eyelashes are dated , unless you 're going for the retro look . So I talked to her about that , and she totally agreed . '  Gushing about the star , who Francesca travels the world with , she says that Beyonce 's natural beauty means she actually requires very little make-up , and the hardest look she has ever created was making her ugly .  ` Believe it or not , one of the hardest looks to do was for Cadillac Records when she looked so distressed . Can you imagine - somebody with perfect skin , beautiful almond-shaped eyes , very luminous and happy and full of joy -- to make her look so bad ? '   \n",

            "So it was n't quite the ` celebration of football ' Roberto Martinez hoped it would be but , on this occasion , he did n't grumble .  Having made light work of progressing through Group H , dismantling Wolfsburg and Lille en route to the last 32 of the Europa League , Everton 's manager took the chance to experiment and give opportunities to the ` diamonds of our Academy ' in an environment free from pressure .  But , as it turned out , this transpired to be a game that will not live long in the memory , not even for those who were given their first starts against Krasnodar . On a rain-sodden Merseyside night , Everton ended the Europa League group stage with a lacklustre defeat .  VIDEO Scroll down for Roberto Martinez : Very pleased with reaction of the young players  Ricardo Laborde scored on the half-hour mark to give Krasnodar the lead at Goodison Park  The Colombian winger celebrates his goal against Everton on a wet evening at Goodison Park  Krasnodar ended the Europa League group stage with a victory over Everton at Goodison Park , their first win in Group H  Everton -LRB- 4-2-3-1 -RRB- : Robles 4.5 ; Browning 6 , Alcaraz 5 , Barry 6 , Garbutt 6 ; Oviedo 5 , Ledson 6 ; Atsu -LRB- Dowell 11mins , 6 -RRB- , McAleny 5.5 -LRB- Long 80 -RRB- , Pienaar 5 ; Kone 5.5  Subs not used : Griffiths , Grant , Kenny , Williams , Jones  Booked : Kone , Pienaar  Krasnodar -LRB- 4-3-3 -RRB- : Sinitsin 6 ; Petrov 6 , Sigurdsson 7 , Granqvist 7 , Kaleshin 6.5 ; Izmailov 7.5 , Gezinski 7 , Pereyra 6.5 ; Laborde 7 , Wanderson 7 , Joaozinho 7  Subs not used : Kavlinov , Burmistrov , Novak , Kuzmichev , Ageev , Nesterenko , Starkov  Goals : Laborde 30  Booked : Granqvist , Sigurdsson  Referee : Istvan Kovacs -LRB- Romania -RRB- 6  MOTM : Marat Izmailov  Att : 20,260  Ratings by DOMINIC KING at Goodison Park  A goal from Ricardo Laborde in the first half , when he capitalised on dreadful goalkeeping from Joel Robles , gave Krasnodar victory yet Martinez will not be unduly concerned . Never one to dwell on a negative , he saw this as a worthwhile experiment after they overcame initial stage fright .  ' I thought the first half was really cagey , the second half was completely different , ' said Martinez . ` They got a unique experience and after this , we have different footballers . It was very pleasing to see the way they progressed . It was just a shame we could n't get a positive result . '  Much of the interest beforehand centred on Arouna Kone , who had celebrated two birthdays since he last kicked a ball in public for Everton 's first team . This , the Ivorian hoped , would be the beginning of what he called a ` big comeback ' .  Yet a closer examination of the teamsheet showed there were other stories , not least the promotion of 17-year-old Ryan Ledson , a young midfielder for whom Martinez has high hopes . So do England , as illustrated by Under 21 head coach Gareth Southgate 's attendance .  Ledson , who has been at Everton 's Academy since he was five , has enjoyed a memorable 12 months . He signed his first professional contract in August , having lead England 's Under-17s to success in Malta in the European Championships .  Given a key role in midfield , Ledson worked hard and showed an impressive understanding of the game . He used the ball smartly and never being afraid to bark out orders to those with more experience -- Gareth Barry , playing as a central defender , would testify to that .  Showing what Martinez described as ` football arrogance ' , Ledson was the pick of a bunch that included Conor McAleny , Kieran Dowell -- who replaced the hamstrung Christian Atsu -- and Chris Long . This is unlikely to be the last time you hear about him .  ` You need days like to day -- it is one in a lifetime , ' said Martinez . ` It was just a real shame that some of them were shocked in the first half but you saw what they could do in the second half . '  Everton manager Roberto Martinez -LRB- left -RRB- made a number of changes to his team that Steven Pienaar -LRB- right -RRB- captained  Everton 's Darron Gibson -LRB- left -RRB- , Tim Howard -LRB- second left -RRB- , Ross Barkley -LRB- centre -RRB- , Phil Jagielka -LRB- second right -RRB- , Leighton Baines -LRB- right , back -RRB- , Seamus Coleman -LRB- right , front -RRB- and James McCarthy -LRB- centre , front -RRB- enjoy a night off as they watch from the stands    GROUP H FINAL STANDINGS  Ricardo Laborde pounced on poor goalkeeper from Joel Robles to score for Krasnodar - CLICK HERE FOR MATCH ZONE  Everton , to their credit , slashed the price of tickets in an attempt to a get a healthy pre-Christmas crowd -- the most expensive was # 15 -- but the crackle you associate with this stadium on a European night was absent . This , effectively , was an exhibition match .  Still , it was one Everton wanted to win . Their progress in Europe so far has been serene and they had the first opportunity in the 14th minute , when Kone latched on to a pass from McAleny and drilled a 25-yard shot that Krasnodar keeper Andrei Sinitsin beat away .  Krasnodar , though , had not travelled just to fulfil their obligations and in the 16th minute Wanderson , the Brazilian striker , burst clear and smashed a shot straight at Robles that left the keeper with a bloodied nose .  The blow seemed to cloud his senses as , he was found wanting when Krasnodar broke away , Laborde , their Colombian midfielder , latched on to a ball from Marat Izmailov to open the scoring .  Aroune Kone made his long-awaited return for Everton as he started the Europa League contest against Krasnodar  Everton 's on-loan Ghanaian winger Christian Atsu hurdles a challenge from Krasnodar 's Andreas Granqvist  Everton 's stand-in captain Pienaar attempts a shot on goal , but he could n't find the target  Joel Robles was left with a bloody nose after being hit in the face by a shot from Krasnodar 's Wanderson  Everton 's stand-in goalkeeper receives treatment on his face from the physio to try to stem the flow of blood  Robles should have done better . He did n't know whether to dive at Laborde 's feet or stand tall and did neither . Laborde squeezed his shot inside the near post to leave Goodison silent , save for the 14 cheering fans who had made a 2,000-mile trek here from Russia .  A similar pattern followed after the break . Everton played at a higher tempo but never looked like equalising . If anything , Krasnodar should have doubled their lead but Izamailov fluffed his lines after Robles was caught in no man 's land . By then , they had done enough . Still Martinez was content .  ` It 's part of what we want to achieve to develop our youngsters , ' he said . ` If we do n't give them opportunities they will never learn . ' \n",

            "By Victoria Woollaston and Fiona Macrae  If you 're terrible with numbers but never forget a face , your life could be about to get quite a bit easier .  Because scientists are planning to replace fiddly passwords and PINs with an access code based on pictures .  The Facelock system capitalises on the human brain 's excellent ability to recognise faces , which its creators say makes it almost impossible to forget .  The Facelock system asks users to identify familiar faces , including friends and celebrities , across a range of photos , known as a Challenge Grid -LRB- pictured -RRB- . By showing faces only the user recognises , the research team claim it 's harder for hackers to gain access to web accounts  Facelock asks people to identify familiar faces across a range of different photos .  Previous research has found people recognise a face even if images are poor .  The system uses a set of faces known to a user , to create a personalised ` lock ' .  Users can pick portraits of people familiar to them , which can include idols such as sports personalities , musicians or even poker players .  Researchers then create a set of faces known to that user only , to make it difficult for hackers to break into accounts .  If we know someone well we will quickly recognise them in a photo even if it is blurred or hazy .  But when we are shown two pictures of a stranger , we often assume the images show two different people .  Scientists from Glasgow and York universities asked volunteers to name Z-list celebrities who they knew well , but most people would not .  The team then made up panels of nine pictures , each showing one celebrity face and eight strangers .  Volunteers were shown four of the panels and asked to spot the faces they knew . They got all four right almost 100 per cent of the time .  Even a year later , they still did extremely well , journal PeerJ reports .  The researchers said this is because , unlike with passwords , they did not have to memorise anything .  Do you remember : Faces may soon replace passwords but will you remember who 's who ?  This scatterplot shows the relationship between personal attackers ' acquaintance ratings , and the number of correctly guessed targets in their first attacks . The area of each datapoint is sized to correspond to the number of cases contributing to it  Previous research found matching identical images -LRB- a -RRB- is trivial , matching different images of unfamiliar faces is hard -LRB- b -RRB- , but matching different images of familiar faces is easy -LRB- c -RRB-  Tests also showed it was very hard for strangers to crack the code .  Spouses sometimes spotted all four faces , but the risk could be cut by using more obscure celebrities or more pictures .  Lead author Dr Rob Jenkins said : ` Pretending to know a face you do n't know is like pretending to know a language you do n't know -- it just does n't work .  ` The only system that can reliably recognise faces is a human who is familiar with the faces concerned . '  It is hoped software firms will use the research to create photo access codes for computers and mobile phones .  The ` lock ' consists of a series of face grids , and each grid is constructed so that one face is familiar to the user , whilst all other faces are unfamiliar .  Authentication is a matter of simply touching the familiar face in each grid .  But for fraudsters , looking at the same grid will be left confused as none of the faces stand out .  Researchers said the system is better than current methods as users do n't have to consign complex passwords or PINs to memory , or put names to faces .  Past psychological research has shown that familiarity with a face is virtually impossible to lose , and in the current study users authenticated easily even after a one-year gap .  In contrast , disused passwords can be forgotten within days .  Plus , Facelock is said to be hard to crack .  Researchers asked volunteer attackers to watch a successful authentication sequence based on four target faces , so they could pick out the same four faces from similar test grids .  However , the attacks were thwarted simply by using different photos of the same faces in the test grids .  For the user , who is familiar with the target faces , it is easy to recognise the faces across a range of images .  For the attacker , who is unfamiliar with the target faces , generalising across images is difficult . \n",

            "By Joel Christie  The title company executive who committed suicide with a nail gun in the wake of investigations into his alleged financial mismanagement had a $ 1 million life insurance policy that named his business as its beneficiary .  But the insurance company holding the policy says it learned after Richard Talley 's death that the beneficiary had changed -- from American Title Service , now in bankruptcy , to his wife , Cheryl Talley , who co-founded the company and was its majority owner .  It remains unclear ow close to the 56-year-old 's suicide the switch was made .  However filings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court show that Talley had a $ 1 million policy with Transamerica Insurance Co. in which he named American Title as the recipient upon his death , The Denver Post reported .  Richard Talley , pictured with his wife of 25 years Cheryl , committed suicide with a nail gun at his home in Colorado on February 4 . It has now emerged Talley 's life insurance policy was transferred into his wife 's name before he killed himself  ` However , subsequent to Mr. Talley 's death , Transamerica received notice of change of beneficiary to Cheryl Talley , ' according to an inventory of American Title 's personal property in a bankruptcy filing .  Transamerica was listed among the company 's unsecured creditors , indicating the company was paying the premium .  American Title also listed the Denver Broncos , the Colorado Rockies , the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame , and Valley Country Club among 62 pages of unsecured creditors .  American Title filed for bankruptcy shortly after Talley was found dead in his Aurora home on Feb. 4 , the result of six finishing nails fired into his chest and head from a nail gun .  The company on Thursday changed its bankruptcy filing to Chapter 7 liquidation , citing assets of just $ 100 and the $ 1 million life-insurance proceeds .  Other assets might exist , but American Title 's underwriter , Title Resource Guarantee Service in Texas , seized its bank accounts .  Mr Talley , 57 , was found dead in his garage from the self-inflicted wounds in Centennial , Colorado  Mr Talley had allegedly been having trouble with his business before he took his own life in Colorado  The company 's lawyer firm , hired to ` wind-down ' its operation in bankruptcy , has said in court filings that it is unable to complete many of the required documents because they were confiscated by investigators .  The attorney general 's office has refused to turn over any of more than 100 boxes of records it raided from American Title 's headquarters in Greenwood Village last month .  Title Resource has alleged American Title 's books were doctored to cover up about $ 2 million in missing funds , mostly escrow payments for real estate transactions .  Investigations have been launched by the Attorney General and the state division of insurance .  Former employees of the company have also filed claims for missing retirement contributions , with several saying the matter is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor .

            "By Sara Smyth  PUBLISHED :  12:19 EST , 15 July 2013   |  UPDATED :  16:20 EST , 15 July 2013  Charged : Ray Wilkins arrived at a Surrey Magistrates court for his three-day drink-driving trial  Former England and Chelsea footballer star Ray Wilkins unleashed a foul-mouthed tirade when he was found to be three times over the legal drink-driving limit , a court heard today .  Mr Wilkins , 56 , allegedly slurred his words and was unable to stand up when he was pulled over by police as he drove home in May last year .  The Sky Sports commentator is said to have called police procedures a ` f ****** joke ' when he was told he could not call his wife until he had given breath samples .  CCTV footage played to the court showed the pundit apparently struggling to complete the tests .  Mr Wilkins is heard to say : ` F ****** hell , I ca n't even phone my missus . This is a f ****** joke . I 'm not going to bash up anybody ... this is ridiculous , absolutely ridiculous . '  The 56-year-old was arrested in the early hours of the morning near his home in Cobham , Surrey after an officer spotted his car ` weaving ' down the road moments after it allegedly ` lurched ' forward and hit a traffic island .  North Surrey Magistrates ' Court heard that Mr Wilkins was forced to lean on his Jaguar car for support when he was asking to get out of his car .  PC Nicholas Skidmore told the court today : ` There was a strong smell of intoxicating liquor in the vehicle and around him .  ` When he got out of the vehicle , he could n't stand up properly .  ` He had to lean against the car . '  The officer - who claimed he did not recognise Mr Wilkins when he arrested him - said the former footballer fell asleep in his unmarked police car .  The officer was heard questioning Ray Wilkins about his broadcasting job while he was in custody .  In CCTV footage shown to the court , he was heard to say : ` I 'm not really into football myself ... are you into it in a big way ? '  Wilkins answered : ' I have been for many years , yeah . '  Paul Lund , prosecuting , said Wilkins would challenge the reliability of the result of his breath test .  ` Mr Wilkins says that he ca n't have drunk enough to produce that high reading , ' he told the court .  ` That , in the crown 's submission , is an assertion without merit .  ` At the end of the day , the defence is relying on Mr Wilkins ' assertion that he had n't drunk enough ... he would say that , would n't he ? '  Mr Wilkins , who notched up 84 caps for England during his playing days , was more than three times over the legal drink-driving limit .  Heyday : Ray Wilkins played for Chelsea and England during his career as a midfielder . He denies drink-driving charges  Tests revealed he had 104 and 102 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - almost three times the legal limit of 35 microgrammes .  A roadside reading recorded 109 microgrammes in 100 millilitres of alcohol .  Wilkins stared straight ahead as the CCTV footage was played to the court .  Pc Skidmore said he was unable to recall everything Wilkins said while in custody but added : ' -LRB- He said -RRB- he knew that he had done wrong and he wanted to speak to his wife as soon as possible . '  During his career , the former footballer played at various clubs including Chelsea , Manchester United , AC Milan and Queens Park Rangers and was awarded an MBE in 1993 for services to football .  He is standing trial at North Surrey Magistrates ' Court in Staines-upon-Thames , where he denies drink-driving .  The three-day case continues .

            "Town halls have spent tens of millions of pounds rehiring staff they had made redundant , it was reported last night .  Much of the cash has gone on agency social workers but an increasing amount is paid to interim managers and consultants , who can earn # 1,000 a day .  Some have returned after receiving big redundancy packages .  Birmingham City Council headquarters : The local authority topped the list of councils who spent the most on agency and consultancy workers since 2010-2011 , with # 155million spent since that financial year  An investigation by The Times revealed that dozens of authorities have spent more than # 50million on agency and consultancy workers since 2010-11 , with five spending more than # 100million .  The total figure spent on such workers over that period is # 5billion . The peak was in 2013-14 when more than # 1.2 billion was spent .  Jonathan Isaby , chief executive of Taxpayers Alliance , said : ` This -LSB- # 5billion -RSB- is a scandalous figure and one that needs to be justified .  ` Scandalous ' : Jonathan Isaby , chief executive of Taxpayers Alliance , said the councils must stop the revolving door of rehiring redundant workers  ` There have been all sorts of promises about bringing the cost of administering down . Taxpayers will be particularly concerned at the number of former employees re-employed on more expensive contracts . The lucrative revolving door needs to rapidly come to a halt . '  A freedom of information requested by The Times revealed that the biggest councils , the counties and London boroughs were among the worst offenders .  Birmingham City Council topped the list , spending # 155 million since 2010-11 , followed by Essex County Council on # 133.5 million and Kent County Council on # 127million .  Seventeen London boroughs also spent between # 50million and # 125million on agency and consultancy staff .  Louise Tibbert , president of the Public Sector People Management Association and head of HR at Hertfordshire county council , said that social workers often went back to councils where they had worked before , but this was also the case for higher-paid staff .  She said : ` Many go to the private sector for better pay in legal , finance and HR or general management roles . There is a big chance that local government will pay the same for them to come back as consultants . '  Over the past five years councils have had their budgets slashed by more than # 20billion and lost more than 400,000 jobs .  Some councils have been forced to close or reduce a range of services including road maintenance , street cleaning and home care for elderly after having their central funding slashed by almost 40 per cent since 2010 .  Tony Travers , local government expert at the London School of Economics , said that too many jobs were cut too quickly in search for early big savings and councils had found that they could not provide their services without bringing the staff back .   \n",

            "By Daily Mail Reporter  PUBLISHED :   18:01 EST , 6 March 2014    | UPDATED :   18:03 EST , 6 March 2014  New York Yankees great Mariano Rivera picked up one more epic save six months after retiring from baseball .  The legendary reliever has renovated a long-vacant historic church in suburban New York that will be the new home of his wife 's ministry starting Thursday .  For years , Rivera had been crediting God for his skills on the field , where he tallied a record 652 saves before retiring last season .  Open for business : Former New York Yankees relief pitcher Mariano Rivera opens the door to his new Refugio de Esperanza -LRB- Refuge of Hope -RRB- church , Thursday , in New Rochelle  Historic site : the 107-year-old Presbyterian church was abandoned in the 1970s and was eventually bought by New Rochelle  Princely gift : Rivera bought the abandoned church building so that his wife , Clara -LRB- right -RRB- , a Pentecostal minister , could expand her congregation  Now his foundation has poured about $ 3million into restoring the 107-year-old church for Refugio de Esperanza , or Refuge of Hope , the Pentecostal Christian congregation led by his wife , Clara .  Rivera , 44 , has been quiet about the project , declining to speak about it in advance of the opening . Most residents walking by earlier this week did not even know he was involved .  But he briefly mentioned the opening of the church after receiving a humanitarian award from the Jackie Robinson Foundation Monday .  ` You do n't do it to be recognized , ' he said . ` You do it because it comes from the heart . You want to please the Lord . '  The handsome grey stone building had been a Presbyterian church but was abandoned in the 1970s and was eventually bought by New Rochelle , a diverse city of about 77,000 just 6 miles north of the Bronx .  The church is next door to the police and courts headquarters , and the police had used some of the space to store evidence , said architect Jonathan Villani .  Meanwhile , his wife 's congregation had been outgrowing its meeting place -- the Rivera home . Rivera told New York magazine last year , ` We only fit like 50 people , 60 people tops . '  Hands-on approach : Rivera 's business partner said the retired Yankee was acting as a general contractor on the project and overseeing every detail  Mixed group : Rivera said his wife congregation is made up of 50-60 people of different ethnicity and various walks of life  Inaugural prayer : Ana Rivera , left , prays during the opening service at Refugio de Esperanza  ` We have whites , we have blacks , we have Hispanics , ' he said . ` We have all kinds . It does n't matter . As long as you love Christ , we in it . And if you do n't love him , we will work with you so we put you on the right path . '  The congregation 's website says it ` felt the need to organize a local church that would not only present the message of salvation to its attendees , but also provide programs that would meet the needs of the less fortunate in the community . '  Plans call for a ` learning center ' that will provide education , sports and other after-school programs to children .  ` He 's doing something not just for his faith but at the same time setting up a place where he can help kids , ' said Brandon Steiner , a Rivera business partner whose sports memorabilia firm is headquartered in New Rochelle .  Steiner said he 's never seen Rivera so focused on a project .  ` He was like the general contractor , ' Steiner said , laughing . ` He was in there directing painters . '  The city agreed to sell the building to Rivera for $ 1 in return for his promise to rehabilitate it .  One opponent at the time , City Councilman Louis Trangucci , said Wednesday he still feels the city should have tried to get more for the property .  All smiles : The former Bronx Bomber addressed the worshipers from the alter of his wife 's new church , with Edeli Zorilla , left , acting as a translator  But he said the project has only enhanced the area ` and I support what Mariano had done with the church . '  Mayor Noam Bramson said the city did not have the money it would have taken to save the building.Villani said the church needed plenty of work : the bell tower had begun collapsing , a new front wall needed to be built and new stained glass windows installed .  ` We loved the stonework , and some of the inside beams were still in good condition , ' he said.Across the street at Kenny 's Barbershop , Carlos Sanchez has been watching the renovation every day .  ` It looks a lot better , ' the barber said . He even met Rivera at the site several times .  ` He 's a cool guy , ' Sanchez said . ` And look what he 's doing , a new church in the neighborhood . ' \n",

            "By Emma Reynolds  PUBLISHED :  04:45 EST , 8 October 2012   |  UPDATED :  13:27 EST , 8 October 2012  These touching photographs show a lioness adopting a helpless antelope calf - after she killed its mother .  The intimidating beast had just finished devouring a Ugandan Kob , and had the wounds to show for it , when its terrified child emerged .  Instead of making the defenceless infant her dessert , however , the merciful creature took pity on it and carried it away to safety .  Walk on the wild side : After killing and eating this antelope 's mother , the lioness reacts to the baby kob 's arrival with a roar of suspicion  One-sided meeting : The powerful predator crouches down on her haunches and looks ready to pounce on the terrified little creature  Hear me roar ! The lioness tries to scare off the unsteady little calf with a deafening rumble  Please be my friend : The lonely , motherless kob refuses to run away from the intimidating sight  Photographer Adri De Visser , 50 , captured this fascinating display of nature in its purest beauty at every stage .  The lioness first stares at the calf in shock , before roaring angrily at it to make it go away .  Finally , her maternal instincts take over , and after batting the quivering calf with a paw , she picks up the orphaned baby and carries it off like one of her own cubs .  Other tourists in the Queen Elizabeth National Park , Uganda , later reported seeing the calf running around unharmed , so its luck clearly held out .  Brazen : The lioness looks completely nonplussed when the offspring of her natural enemy begins nuzzling at her feet  Close encounter : The intimate shots were captured at Uganda 's Queen Elizabeth National Park  Confused emotions : The pitying lioness gently pats at the innocent child of her prey from moments earlier  Mr De Visser said : ' I was told there were two lionesses close by feeding on a kill so I went to go take some wildlife pictures .  ` When I got there , I saw the lionesses feeding on a Uganda kob 's carcass .  ' I followed them for a while and they went up a tree to rest from the sun .  ' I was watching them when I heard a noise - it was the kob 's fawn that had been hiding in the long grass .  Out of Africa : The fascinating pictures show the incredible workings of nature  Unfair fight : The larger creatures evidently decided she should protect the little antelope , despite them being natural enemies  Firm friends : She carries it off by the scruff of the neck , as with a cub , not by the front as she would a kill  Stunning scene : Photographer Adri De Visser captured the heart-stopping episode at Queen Elizabeth National Park , Uganda  ` One of the lionesses heard it too and came down from the tree .  The kob is an antelope found across sub-Saharan Africa in the northern savannah .  They are usually found in floodplain grasslands , where there is an abundance of water and green grass .  Kob tend to be inactive during the heat of the day and live in groups of females and calves or just males .  ` The fawn just stood there before running into the lioness . It went between its legs like it was trying to get its milk .  ` The lioness was really confused and they stood there for around 45 minutes .  ` Then a park ranger turned up on his motorbike which made a really loud noise , which I think frightened the animals .  ` So the lioness picked the fawn up by the neck and carried it off like one of its own .  ` We heard from a group of tourists that the fawn was later spotted alive and well .

            "In a discovery that has shocked everyone involved , experts have found DNA can survive the harsh conditions of space as well as re-entry into the atmosphere .  Scientists who attached small double strands of DNA to the outer casing of a rocket said they were ` completely surprised ' when more than half the samples remained intact .  This was despite temperatures soaring to more than 1,000 °C -LRB- 1,800 °F -RRB- during the short flight to sub-orbital space and back , and it raises the possibility of extraterrestrial life molecules arriving on Earth from space .  Scientists at the University of Zurich have discovered that DNA can survive the harsh conditions of space and re-entry into the atmosphere . The finding was made by attaching DNA to the outer casing of a rocket , shown launching from the Esrange base in Kiruna , Sweden . It has led to questions about the origin of life on Earth  The research , published online in the journal Plos One , was carried out by scientists from the University of Zurich in Switzerland .  The Texus-49 sub-orbital mission launched from the European base of Esrange in Kiruna , northern Sweden , and was originally intended to study the influence of gravity on the genes of human cells carried inside the rocket .  But scientists decided , in addition , to test the effects space travel has on DNA when carried at three positions on the rocket 's outer casing - and found it survived .  Panspermia is the theory that life exists throughout the universe and is spread by asteroids and comets , in addition to simply drifting through the cosmos .  Panspermia proposes life forms that can survive the effects of space , such as extremophiles , become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life .  These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks .  If met with ideal conditions on a new planet 's surface , the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins , it is believed .  Many scientists believe comets may have brought organic building blocks of life such as amino acids to the Earth early in its history .  But some go further and suggest that DNA , the essential molecule of life itself , could reach the Earth in meteoric dust , 100 tonnes of which hit the planet each day - a theory known as panspermia .  During the experiment , around 53 per cent of the DNA was recovered from the grooves in screw heads , and more than a third remained fully functional .  The ` plasmid ' DNA carried genes for fluorescence and antibiotic resistance .  It was shown to function by conferring antibiotic resistance to bacteria , and driving a flourescent marker in nucleated cells .  Dr Cora Thiel , one of the scientists from the University of Zurich , said : ` We were completely surprised to find so much intact and functionally active DNA . '  Professor Oliver Ullrich , from the same university , added : ` This study provides experimental evidence that the DNA 's genetic information is essentially capable of surviving the extreme conditions of space and the re-entry into Earth 's dense atmosphere . '  The Texus-49 sub-orbital mission launched from the European Esrange Space Center -LRB- shown on map -RRB- and was originally intended to study the influence of gravity on the genes of human cells carried inside the rocket - but the surprising DNA discovery is likely to spark considerable attention  The type of DNA carried by the rocket was known as ` plasmid DNA ' -LRB- stock image shown -RRB- . This carried genes for fluorescence and antibiotic resistance . It was shown to function on its return to Earth by conferring antibiotic resistance to bacteria , and driving a flourescent marker in nucleated cells  The research also suggested that scientists conducting space missions to other planets needed to be careful about contamination .  Proffesor Ullrich said : ` The results show that it is by no means unlikely that , despite all the safety precautions , space ships could also carry terrestrial DNA to their landing site .  ` We need to have this under control in the search for extraterrestrial life . '  Back in August , traces of plankton and other microorganisms were found living on the exterior of the International Space Station -LRB- ISS -RRB- by Russian cosmonauts .  They claim the plankton were not carried there at launch - but are thought to have been blown there by air currents on Earth .  Incredibly , the tiny organisms were found to be able to survive in the vacuum of space despite the freezing temperatures , lack of oxygen and cosmic radiation .  Some said the plankton may simply have been contamination from other areas of the ISS .  Nonetheless , the discovery appeared to prove extremely primitive life could survive in the harsh environment of space .  And , coupled with this latest research , the finding raises interesting questions about the origin of life on Earth .  Many scientists believe comets may have brought organic building blocks of life such as amino acids to the early Earth . But , some go further and suggest DNA , the essential molecule of life itself , could reach the Earth in meteoric dust from elsewhere in the universe -LRB- stock image shown -RRB- - a theory known as panspermia  Back in August , traces of plankton and other microorganisms were found living on the exterior of the International Space Station -LRB- ISS -RRB- -LRB- pictured -RRB- by Russian cosmonauts .

Roy ` Murph ' Guest , 51 , posted a string of vile comments on Facebook about Julie Bailey , 51 , after she set up the Cure the NHS campaign to highlight failings at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital , where her mother died in 2007 .  Today it emerged that Guest , who in one message said he hoped Mrs Bailey would suffer a ` life-threatening illness ' , had been fired from his post as senior paramedic with West Midlands Ambulance Service .  Guest , who was initially suspended while an internal investigation was carried out , has now been sacked , and faces being struck off after being referred to the Health and Care Professions Council -LRB- HPC -RRB- on charges of serious professional misconduct .  A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said : ` We can confirm that , following a formal investigation into comments made on Facebook , a member of staff has been dismissed .  ` The case has also been referred to the Health and Care Professions Council . '  In February Guest - who said he had received treatment at the hospital for a collapsed lung , broken ribs and pneumonia - launched a vicious attack on Ms Bailey , who runs a cafe in Stafford .  In a hate-filled rant , he wrote : ` Julie Bailey , I hope you suffer a life threatening illness at night where you have to travel furthur -LSB- sic -RSB- than you should do because your local hospital is closed -LRB- your fault -RRB- .  ` Serves you right , go back to yer bacon butties girl and leave the staff alone , they are the heart of OUR hospital and do a brilliant job , under extreme circumstances , just shut yer face and leave them alone now , you 've done enough damage , stick together girlies , i for one am behind you 1000 per cent .  Vile remarks : Murph Guest -LRB- left -RRB- made the comments about Cure The NHS founder Julie Bailey -LRB- right -RRB- , who has led calls for an inquiry into Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust  ` Do n't let these sad people grind you down , she 's the owner of a ******* cafe for **** sake . '  In another entry he wrote : ` This woman was singlehandedly to blame for all this media pressure and negative comments about the hospital ... she could n't care less , money springs to mind . '  In March Staffordshire Police said that Guest would not be charged after officers deemed his comments did not cross the threshold for criminal charges .  Roy ` Murph ' Guest has now been sacked from his job with West Midlands Ambulance Service  Astonishing rant : The senior West Midlands Ambulance Service worker said on a Facebook group in support of staff at Stafford Hospital that Miss Bailey , 51 , should ` shut her face ' and ` go back to her bacon butties '  A spokesperson said : ` After reviewing all of the information available to us , and taking into consideration national guidance , it was decided that the comments do not meet the threshold for criminal charges .  ` We have been liaising with Julie Bailey throughout the investigation and updated her about its outcome . '  Ms Bailey set up Cure the NHS to campaign for an investigation into Mid Staffordshire NHS trust which later found up to 1,200 patients had died needlessly .  Following the harrowing death of her mother , Bella , at the hospital , Ms Bailey vowed to bring those responsible to account .  Shocking report : Up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died from neglect at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust -LRB- Stafford Hospital pictured -RRB- from 2005 to 2008 with thousands of others suffering ` inhumane ' treatment  After the investigation into Guest 's comments was launched earlier this year , mother-of-two Ms Bailey said : ` It has been the same for five years now , it 's the same as the threats I have always had hoping that I get some kind of disease .  ` These people need to be rooted out , they are just the kind of bully who works for the NHS .  ` I have had a great response from lots of NHS staff , overworked staff have written to me to thank us for our hard work . '  Mr Guest , 54 , made the threats even though his mother Irene died at the trust in 2008 having suffered from dementia .  His father , Jeff , 82 , a member of Cure the NHS , said she was never bathed , not properly fed and was left to lie in soiled sheets .  Mr Guest -- whose wife Claire , 54 , is a nurse at the trust -- apologised and removed the comments from Facebook after he was hauled up for making them .  Loss : Miss Bailey started her campaign after her mother Bella -LRB- pictured -RRB- , 86 , died in 2007 at the hospital  In February he said : ` I 'm a healthcare professional .  ` I 've apologised for my comments on Facebook and I 've removed the comments . '  Mrs Bailey set up Cure the NHS in an attempt to bring those responsible to justice after witnessing appalling treatment when her mother Bella was admitted to the hospital in 2007 .  She wrote to the Healthcare Commission and campaigned with other relatives of patients . \n",

            "By Sean O'hare  PUBLISHED :  12:10 EST , 7 December 2012   |  UPDATED :  12:28 EST , 7 December 2012  Dean Cole , 24 , pleaded guilty to his part in the conspiracy before the trial  A member of a smash-and-grab gang who smashed their way into top stores using high-powered motorbikes and sledgehammers is suing Scotland Yard - claiming he was injured in a police ambush .  Dean Cole , 24 , was part of the gang that targeted 46 stores in London 's West End - including stores run by Apple , Christian Dior , Dolce & Gabbana and Jimmy Choo .  Cole , from Holloway , North London , was riding a stolen high-speed bike when police sprang an ambush in Mayfair in August last year . He was rammed by an unmarked police vehicle after a raid on Chanel in Bond Street , leaving him with a leg injury .  He admitted at Southwark Crown Court to his part in the conspiracy to commit burglary but may be unfit to appear in the dock for sentencing on January 11 when the case comes up again , in the dock .  Now he has instructed solicitors to make a claim for compensation against Scotland Yard , alleging that the police action caused his injury .  A Scotland Yard spokesman said yesterday -LRB- FRI -RRB- : ` We can confirm , as of late November 2012 , the Metropolitan Police Service has been served with a claim form by solicitors who are representing Dean Cole . We await further details of that claim .  ` As with all claims , once the full details have been received , then the Metropolitan Police Service will assess them . If a claim is without merit , we will defend it vigorousl  The gang 's crime spree , organised by lovers Steve Dedman , 20 , and Lizzie Andrews , 19 , was only brought to an end when they attracted too much attention - robbing a boutique owned by designer Anya Hindmarch just days after her bags were used by Royal Wedding guests .  Scotland Yard were forced to launch a major undercover operation to catch the gang involving stakeouts outside London stores lasting over 100 nights .  The young thieves , convicted this week , have been compared with Fagin 's gang of pickpockets in the Charles Dickens ' classic story Oliver Twist .  Four members of the gang were convicted of raiding 46 designer stores . Three others had earlier pleaded guilty to similar offences .  Ringleader Steve Dedman , 20 , of King 's Cross , was one of two men found guilty of robbery .  His girlfriend and Cole admitted conspiracy to burgle at an earlier hearing .  Scroll down for video  Dedman , pictured left , was yesterday found guilty of two counts of robbery and cleared of three . His girlfriend Lizzy Andrews , 19 , right , pleaded guilty to her part in the conspiracy before the trial  The youthful thieves , who were well-trained and often knew exactly which items were the most valuable , drew comparisons with Fagin 's gang of pickpockets in the Charles Dickens ' classic Oliver Twist .  They are estimated to have stolen up to # 1million worth of goods during nearly 50 robberies last year .  ` The gang mainly , but not always , stole handbags or computer equipment , ' said prosecutor Tim Clark .  ` Their method , known and `` smash and grab '' , was dramatic but also amazingly efficient and quick . '  The gang would arrive on the scene on up to four stolen motorbikes with two people on each , often using the bikes to smash stores ' windows .  Targeted : Fashion designer Anya Hindmarch had her boutique raided by the gang days after her handbags has been worn by guests at the Royal Wedding  They armed themselves with sledgehammers and crowbars for some raids , while other times they claimed to be carrying knives and one passer-by was warned off with a handgun .  Mr Clark said : ` As the riders waited with the engines running on the bikes , with them pointing away from the shop , the pillion passengers would run into the store and seize valuable items before running back and jumping onto the bikes . '  They would then speed off through the streets of London jumping red lights and going the wrong direction down one-way roads to evade police .  But the gang drew too much attention to themselves after targeting a boutique owned by well-connected designer Anya Hindmarch - days after bags were worn by guests at the Royal Wedding .  Ms Hindmarch , a friend of David and Samantha Cameron , told The Times newspaper : ` They knew exactly what they were doing , they took all of our bestsellers and our most expensive pieces . '  Scotland Yard launched an undercover police operation to bring down the thieves before they did any more damage to London 's retail sector .  When officers raided Dedman 's home he fled across rooftops but was tracked down several weeks later .  In his home they discovered a cake decorated with a motorcyclist crafted from icing sugar , surrounded by handbags bearing the Louis Vuitton logo .  The cake was complete with the words ` Happy Birthday Steven ' around the edge .  Southwark Crown Court heard the gang 's other targets included the flagship Apple Store in Covent Garden , as well as Hush Jewellers and a Dior outlet between April and October 2011 .  When police raided Steven Dedman 's house house they found a cake depicting the scene of one of his ram raids  Grant McCarroll , left , and Daniel White , right , at Southwark Crown Court . McCarroll was found guilty of helping Dedman evade capture , while White was cleared of two counts of handling stolen goods  Fellow raiders Reece Jackson , 19 , left , and Paul Fearn , 22 , right , were also convicted . Fearn was one of six men who raided the Apple store , stealing 37 items totalling # 49,893 .  Dedman , now 20 , was found guilty of two counts of robbery and cleared of three .  He had already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary and admitted he was present at nine smash-and-grab raids last year .  Fellow raiders Reece Jackson , 19 , and Paul Fearn , 22 , were also convicted alongside Grant McCarroll , 19 , who was found guilty of helping Dedman evade capture for two weeks .  Bradley White , 22 , pleaded guilty to his part in the conspiracy before the trial  A fifth man , Daniel White , 19 , was cleared by the jury of two counts of handling stolen goods from Dior and Hush Jewellers .  Dedman 's girlfriend Lizzy Andrews 19 , Bradley White , 22 , and Dean Cole , 24 , pleaded guilty to their part in the conspiracy before the trial .  The gang will be sentenced together on January 11 next year .  Judge Anthony Pitts told them : ` I am not making any promises whatsoever .  ` I want to find out more about you before deciding what the appropriate sentences will be . '  A total of 46 raids were carried out between April and October last year , with nearly # 1m-worth of merchandise stolen .  ` The bikes would then speed away . We have evidence from CCTV , police helicopter footage , and eyewitnesses , that these bikes would travel at very high speeds , up to 100mph , and go through red lights to get away at speed ' .  During one robbery at video agency Adjust Your Set , in Charlotte Mews , Soho , on August 22 , five raiders on three bikes broke into the shop and one shouted at two security guards : ` I 've got a knife , get in the f *** ing corner . '  The gang escaped with a computer , a laptop , and three Apple monitors .  When the gang struck at the offices of Overbury , near Tottenham Court Road , they caved in a glass door .  Security guard Rachid Elkhamlichi confronted one of the robbers but he shouted : ` Stand back , stand back or I 'll do you . '  Detectives probe the scene outside the Chanel store in Old Bond Street after the raid last year  The gang would arrive on the scene on up to four stolen motorbikes with two people on each , often using the bikes to smash the windows  Fearn was one of six men who raided the Apple store , stealing 37 items totalling # 49,893 .  He was caught when officers discovered his abandoned moped outside Wyclif Court , Clerkenwell , central London , and found him hiding inside .  He had a bag containing an iPad , a MacBook Air and two MacBook Pros .  Bradley White and Cole were caught when undercover police rammed into their high-powered bike as they attempted to flee from a raid on Chanel , in Bond Street , and Cole suffered injuries to his leg .  The judge heard Cole may still be unfit to appear in court for sentencing next month , and ordered a medical report to be delivered if he can not be in the dock .  Police discovered a photo on Andrews ' phone of a person holding a newspaper cutting about the raid at Anya Hindmarch 's boutique .  Dedman , of Wharton Street , Bloomsbury , central London , denied five counts of robbery and one count of possession of an imitation firearm .  He was convicted of two counts of robbery , but cleared of three and found not guilty of possession of a firearm .  Jackson , of Holly Park Estate , in Finsbury Park , north London , denied one count of robbery but was found guilty by the jury .  Both have already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary between April 1 and October 11 , 2011 , and Dedman has admitted conspiracy to possess criminal property .  Fearn , of Turnpike House , Goswell Road , Clerkenwell , denied one count of burglary .  McCarroll , of Drummond Way , Offord Road , Islington , north London , denied doing an act intended to pervert the course of public justice .  Both were found guilty by the jury yesterday .  Daniel White of Georges Road , Holloway , north London , denied two counts of handling stolen goods .  He walked free from court after being cleared of both charges .  Andrews , of Radnor Street , Clerkenwell , Bradley White of Georges Road , Holloway , and Cole of Georges Road , Holloway , both north London , admitted conspiracy to commit burglary before the trial .  White and Andrews also admitted conspiracy to possess criminal property .  VIDEO : Caught on camera : Dedman gang raid Jimmy Choo and Apple stores in London ... \n",

            "Fishing fanatic Jason Ebbett hauled in the biggest yellowfin tuna fish ever recorded in Queensland on his first ever game fishing trip in the state .  The gigantic tuna weighed in at 85kg , breaking the previously held Queensland record by 20kg .  Mr Ebbett , a Worongary tradesman , had only recently joined the Gold Coast Game Fishing Club so he could target larger fish , and is thrilled to have access to fresh tuna for his meals .  He and his crew have eaten over $ 3000 worth of the fish since their record breaking catch .  Gold Coast fishing fanatic Jason Ebbett hauled in the biggest yellowfin tuna fish ever recorded in Queensland on his first ever game fishing trip in the state .  Mr Ebbett , a Worongary tradesman had only recently joined the Gold Coast Game Fishing Club so he could target larger fish , and is thrilled to have access to fresh tuna for his meals .  ` We are working our way through it pretty quickly , ' he told the Gold Coast Bulletin .  ` That fish and three others were divided up between about 10 of us . '  Mr Ebbett weighs in at 95kg himself , but said it was a struggle to haul the enormous tuna into the boat , and took over 20 minutes to capture fully .  ` It was pretty hard going pulling it in , ' he said .  ` It took three guys to get it in the boat . '  The Queensland Game Fishing Association confirmed that the catch made by Mr Ebbett was the largest of the species caught in Queensland 's history .  ' I only have a 14-foot -LRB- 4.2 metre -RRB- boat , so this is a way of doing another sort of fishing , ' he said .  ' I have caught a couple of yellowfin tuna before , but nothing close to this size . '  Another member of Mr Ebbett 's crew , Ashleigh Haigh said that while the Gold Coast was not as known for it 's fishing hauls in the same way as other parts of Australia were , he hoped that the massive fish would draw attention to the region .  ` There are lots more fish like this out there to be caught , ' he said .  The gigantic tuna weighed in at 85kg , breaking the previously held Queensland record by 20kg . \n",

With the second squirrel tucked inside a small wooden box marked ` The Great Squirrelisimo ' , our hero laid his tiny hands on a saw that had been carefully placed on the lid , leaving the pair inadvertently recreating a scene familiar to magic lovers around the world .  Max Ellis , 51 , took the photograph in his garden in Teddington , London , after spending several days setting up the scene to entertain his 11-year-old son Gulliver .  The Great Squirrelisimo : The pair of squirrels inadvertently recreate a scene familiar to magic lovers around the world . Mr Ellis said the squirrels spent only a few minutes exploring the box  Trick : Max Ellis took the photograph in his garden in Teddington , London , after spending several days setting up the scene to entertain his 11-year-old son Gulliver  Mr Ellis said he came up with idea for a squirrel magic show after watching professional magicians with Guliver on YouTube in December .  He said : ` My son is very keen on magic so I thought it might be fun to see if I could get the squirrels to perform a classic trick . '  ` It did take quite a while to set up as I wanted it to look realistic . I thought The Great Squirrelisimo was a nice stage name . '  Mr Ellis said the squirrels spent only a few minutes exploring the box , making the task of getting the perfect photograph much more difficult than it looks .  Talent : Mr Ellis said he came up with idea for a squirrel magic show after watching professional magicians with Guliver on YouTube in December  Patience : Mr Ellis spend several days waiting for the squirrels to arrive and explore his box  He also said the squirrels were continually jumping around and chasing each other , leaving them both in exactly the right spot at exactly the right time for only a fraction of a second .  He said : ` It took even longer for them to get into the position I wanted as they are obviously wild animals - they needed a few takes . '  ` In the end I was trying for two or three days but it was worth the wait ... I got the shot I wanted for my son , ' he added .  After spending several days trying to capture the perfect shot , finally doing so proved something of a relief for Mr Ellis - not least because a heavy rainstorm hours later reduced the box to small pieces . \n",

            "A mother-of-two has revolutionized the concept of the traditional family photograph with a series of controversial images entitled ` Domestic Bliss ' .  After spending years as a ` helicopter mother ' who hovered around her children taking a constant stream of photos - while never actually featuring in any family images herself - former dancer Susan Copich came up with the idea for the unique photography project , which she felt would allow her to turn the camera on herself for once and ` project some sort of emotional honesty ' .  ' I needed a creative outlet of my own - one in which I called the shots and controlled everything so no questions or insecurities remained unanswered , ' the actress told MailOnline . ' I think it was a call to power on my part !  ' I needed a creative outlet ' : Susan Copich 's Domestic Bliss project allowed her to create a series of characters which draw on her own ` dark thoughts '  Dark and daring : Many of the images , such as Anger Management -LRB- pictured -RRB- challenge the traditional perceptions of ` normal ' family life  ` Who is the adult ? ' Susan uses the images to highlight current issues - such as the increasing number of young people who have access to guns , which features clearly in ` Toy ' -LRB- pictured -RRB-  ' I loved not having to make myself into someone 's else projection or image , I was able to be exactly as I wanted , for an ex-dancer and actor this was huge . '  Each of the images within the Domestic Bliss series has what Susan calls a ` twist of darkness ' , a daring element that challenges the normal perceptions of family happiness and forces viewers to look beyond the surface of the photo .  And more than that , they have given Susan the chance to put herself at the forefront of family life by altering the day-to-day dynamic of her roles as both a mother and a wife .  ' I wanted to explore living vicariously through character since my life became about taking care of my daughters and husband and home and as much as I love them I needed to express more , ' she said .  ' I wanted to feel relevant again and create something honest and courageous . I did n't want to fall through the cracks of domesticity . '  Although she describes her role in each image as a ` character ' , Susan admits that she drew on her own personal experiences and emotions in order to find inspiration for each one .  ' I did n't want to fall through the cracks of domesticity ' : After spending years taking pictures of her children , Susan wanted to put herself back in the forefront of her family photos  Look again : Each of the images within the Domestic Bliss series has what Susan calls a ` twist of darkness '  The ` twist of darkness ' is her daring element that challenges the normal perceptions of family happiness  ' I dwell in the dark thoughts and recesses of my mind to create character and subject , in order to project them into a frozen moment of time , allowing the story to continue to unfold bilaterally for the viewer , ' Susan writes on her website .  ' I feel a certain freedom to live vicariously through these characters to engage , seek to navigate -LRB- and , no less , avoid -RRB- , both my own personal imperatives as woman , artist , mother , and wife , as well as those -- personal , social and cultural -- that are imposed on me by others . '  While many of the images draw on Susan 's personal thoughts and feelings , a number also highlight current issues and problems within society . For example , ` Toy ' features three young girls playing with a handgun , an image which Susan says is a comment on the ease with which young people are able to access weapons .  Back in front : The images give Susan the chance to put herself at the forefront of family life by altering the day-to-day dynamic of her roles as both a mother and a wife  Family fun : Susan features her daughters - aged 12 and 8 - in many of the images , and admits that the girls have ' a back-pocket full of pride ' thanks to their mother 's work  It 's personal : Although she describes her role in each image as a ` character ' , Susan admits that she drew on her own personal experiences and emotions in order to find inspiration for each one  ` This image is taken directly from the headlines of the newspapers ; unsupervised children with access to guns ; where are the parents ? ' she explained .  ` The only one who looks concerned or worried is the youngest of the children ; looking to her mother or adult figure for reaction or assurance , but clearly not receiving any . Asking who is the adult figure ? '  Susan features her daughters - aged 12 and 8 - in many of the images , and told the Huffington Post that the girls have ' a back-pocket full of pride ' thanks to their mother 's work . \n",

United 's caretaker boss was to meet the Dutchman in Noordwijk , close to where the Holland team are currently training , as the pair looked to thrash out the legend 's future at the club .  Giggs was spotted leaving the town 's Hotel van Oranje mid-afternoon . Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was also supposed to have been in attendance .  VIDEO Scroll down for Holland coach Louis van Gaal names World Cup squad  Talks : Ryan Giggs was pictured in Holland for a meeting with Louis van Gaal on Wednesday  Showdown : Giggs was to meet with Van Gaal for crunch talks over his Manchester United future  Meeting point : Noordwijk 's Hotel van Oranje was the destination of choice for the pair  Incoming : Van Gaal is expected to be announced as the new United boss this week  Van Gaal could be announced as David Moyes ' successor as early as this week , when the club will then reveal who will join the 62-year-old on the coaching staff .  With Phil Neville and goalkeeping coach Chris Woods on the way out and Nicky Butt , and perhaps Paul Scholes , expected to head back to coach the club 's Under 18s , it is Giggs ' future that remains shrouded in doubt .  Van Gaal was expected to hand Giggs a coaching role at the meeting . However , whether or not he decides to stay will depend on whether he thinks the role he is offered is senior enough . He has already indicated privately that he will not stick around if he thinks he is not going to be a fundamental part of the set-up .  Van Gaal is currently in the thick of preparing the Dutch team for a friendly with Ecuador on Saturday and the World Cup in Brazil next month .  However , Holland 's players enjoyed a day off on Wednesday , enabling the coach to meet Giggs and Woodward to discuss the way forward .

I am here for the Dutch team , not as coach of Manchester United . You 'll have to wait until the process is finished or -LRB- put -RRB- questions to Manchester United -- or perhaps to another club . I can not say anything further . '  Different directions : Phil Neville -LRB- left -RRB- will be cut from the coaching staff , though he has n't been told formally , while Paul Scholes will have a meeting on Thursday to discuss his future role at the club  Bearer : United chief Ed Woodward broke the news to Neville in the dressing room after Sunday 's game  Top target : Southampton and England left back Luke Shaw has been linked with a # 27m move  Switch : Robin van Persie was involved in the decision to switch Holland to a 5-3-2 formation \n",

Baylor Fredrickson 's family is desperately seeking a needle in a haystack donor whose bone marrow matches their ailing son 's , something his mother says is ` worse than a 70,000 to 1 shot . '  Now the boy 's family is in a race against time as they scramble to get all the eligible half Japanese/half German individuals tested for their suitably to be donors that they possibly can before time runs out .  Fighting the odds : 7-year-old Baylor Fredrickson is fighting leukemia for the second time . Chemotherapy did n't cure him and now a bone marrow transplant is his only hope  Searching : Baylor faces unusually rough odds in his battle because bone marrow donation is far more complicated than blood donation , especially for mixed race people like him  Baylor suffers from acute myelogenous leukemia , a blood cancer that 's rarely seen in people under 45 .  He is now in his second round of chemotherapy to buy him time as family and friends set up bone marrow registry drives across the Bay Area in hopes they 'll find a match .  ` Since Baylor is Japanese & German mixed race , he will most likely need a donor who is also mixed race , Asian & Caucasian . #HAPA , ' reads one of the flyers on Facebook advertising the many donor events .  Still , the Fredricksons face an uphill battle .  Baylor 's mother Nihei Fredrickson explained to the Contra Costa Times : ` Finding a donor is nothing like matching blood types . bone marrow is EXTREMELY complex . it has to do with antigens/proteins which are located on the surface of the blood cell -LRB- also known as `` markers '' -RRB- . a 10/10 marker match is a perfect match . '  Unfortunately for people like Baylor , nonprofits like the Asian American Donor Program have had to fight for years to try and increase awareness of organ and tissue donation for and within minority groups .  According to Fredrickson , the test for potential donors is easy and pain free .  Hopefully for her son , Mrs. Fredrickson 's message will continue to help get half Japanese , half German donors to testing drives .  ` It 's a long road , ' Fredrickson told the Contra Costa Times . ' A road a second-grader should not have to go through . '  ` worse than a 70,000 to 1 shot ' : Baylor 's family and friends are desperately seeking an appropriate donor through testing drives but face an uphill battle  ` It 's a long road , ' Baylor 's mom Nihei Fredrickson said .

'  ER : His partner drove them both to the Detroit Medical Center 's 24/7 Cardiac Care unit , pictured , and the paramedics dropped off the patient before Hardman himself went to the ER  Hardman , who has now been released from hospital , said he did not know how serious a condition he was in until his chest pains grew stronger and he began sweating .  He described the pain as ' a sudden explosion-type feeling in my chest . ' The 40-year-old is well aware how lucky he was to already be on his way to hospital when he began having the heart attack .  ` If I had n't been in the position I was in , I would have been deceased , ' he told 7 Action News on Monday .  Hardman should be able to return to work after a couple of months of therapy .  However , Barney said the health scare suggests Hardman should slow down a bit .  ` He 's scared . The stress of the job is getting to be too much , ' he said .  The other patient is also recovering and no doubt appreciates Hardman 's dedication to the job .  Hardman has worked as a paramedic for 15 years and has no prior heart health issues . \n",

            "A teenager who was savaged by an alligator is on the road to recovery and even joking about his ordeal with friends and family - despite having his right arm ripped off .  Kaleb Langdale had been swimming in the Caloosahatchee River in Moore Haven , Florida , when he was attacked by the 11ft beast on Monday afternoon .  The 17-year-old thought he had swam away from the giant alligator , only for it to clamp on to his right arm - leaving the teenager with a choice of his life or his limb .  Scroll down for video  Savaged : Kaleb Langdale , pictured before and after his ordeal with the alligator , lost his right arm after wrestling with the 11ft beast in Moore Haven , Florida  Now after swimming to safety without part of his right arm , the brave teen has been recovering in hospital , where he has been in good spirits since his death-defying ordeal .  Brave Kaleb has even joked with his sister that now she ` wo n't be the only left-handed person in the family ' .  The alligator terror began on Monday afternoon when Kaleb 's friends spotted the huge beast near him and shouted .  Kaleb attempted to subdue the alligator by grabbing under its bottom jaw - a move he had apparently seen performed on TV - only to be dragged down by the creature .  The teenager surfaced and began to swim away when the alligator appeared calmer , only for it to lunge at his arm as he threw it behind him while swimming away .  His sister Rebecca told news-press . com : ` He knew he was losing -LRB- his arm -RRB- , so he just took his feet , buried his feet in the alligator 's head and just pushed so that he could get it free , ' Hayes said .  She added , ` If it would have grabbed his body ... he would have drowned . '  Fearsome : The alligator , pictured after it was caught and killed , clamped its jaws onto Kaleb 's right arm while he was swimming in Moore Haven , Florida  Caught : The 11-foot alligator that attacked Kaleb is pulled from the water after it was killed  Swimming spot : The alligator was a known ` nuisance ' and had been tagged for removal the day Mr Langdale was attacked  ` Once it popped loose , he just swam as hard and fast as he could to the dock , where some friends of his pulled him up . '  After Kaleb was rushed to hospital , emergency services made a desperate attempt to hunt the beast and recover Kaleb 's right arm .  Unfortunately , despite finding the creature and killing it , the arm was in too bad a condition to be reattached to the teenager in hospital . \n",

            "By Daily Mail Reporter  PUBLISHED :   21:03 EST , 23 December 2013   | UPDATED :   05:25 EST , 24 December 2013  A robot developed by a Japanese start-up that was recently acquired by Google has left 15 rivals for dead at a two-day competition hosted by the Pentagon to see which machine could cope best in the event of a nuclear meltdown .  Team Schaft 's machine carried out all eight rescue-themed tasks - including scaling a ladder , opening a door , removing debris and clearing debris - to outscore its rivals by a mechanical mile , taking 27 of a possible 32 points .  However NASA 's entry Valkyrie , a $ 3 million creation , failed to score a single point , in an embarrassing blow to the U.S. space station .  The machine was seemingly designed to much in an astronaut sense , weighing a clunky 125kg , rather than being to help out in a crisis .  Schaft ' s closest competitor was IHMC Robotics - which used the Google/Boston Dynamics ATLAS robot - which cored 20 points , the BBC reports .  Three of the other 15 teams that took part failed to secure any points at the event near Miami , Florida , with NASA one of them .  ` Anything you can do , humans ! ' : Japanese robot Schaft completes one of the eight DARPA challenges - climbing a steep ladder  Embarassing : The robot created by NASA -LRB- pictured -RRB- failed to complete any of the eight tasks it was assigned during the two-day DARPA competition  Clean-up : Another task required clearing debris from an entry way . DARPA said the motivated to do the competition are realizing how little robots were able to help during the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown  Four countries took place in the competition - United States , Japan , Korea and China .  Darpa said it had been inspired to organise the challenge after it became clear robots were only capable of playing a very limited role in efforts to contain 2011 's Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown in Japan .  ` What we realised was ... these robots could n't do anything other than observe , ' said Gill Pratt , programme manager for the Darpa Robotics Challenge .  ` What they needed was a robot to go into that reactor building and shut off the valves . '  In order to spur on development of more adept robots the agency challenged contestants to complete a series of tasks , with a time-limit of 30 minutes for each .  Among the challenges were driving a utility vehicle along a course , climb an 8ft-high ladder , remove debris blocking a doorwar and cut a triangular shape in a wall using a cordless drill .  More than 100 teams originally applied to take part , and the number was whittled down to 17 by Darpa ahead of Friday and Saturday 's event .  Schaft is also capable of opening a door . The two-legged humanoid out-mastered rivals by seven points  Epic fail : In a demonstration video , NASA said they were ` thinking about the competition the entire time ' while making Valkyrie , which cost $ 3 million . Maybe they should have been thinking about it actually working ?  Some entered their own machines , while others made use of Atlas - a robot manufactured by another Google-owned business , Boston Dynamics - controlling it with their own software .  One self-funded team from China - Intelligent Pioneer - dropped out at the last moment , bringing the number of contestants who took part at the Homestead-Miami Speedway racetrack to 16 .  Schaft 's 1.48 m -LRB- 4ft 11in -RRB- tall , two-legged robot entered the contest the favourite and lived up to its reputation .  It makes use of a new high-voltage liquid-cooled motor technology that uses a capacitor , rather a battery , for power . Its engineers say this lets its arms move and pivot at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible , in effect giving it stronger `` muscles '' .  Virginia Tech 's Thor-OP The robots had to attach a hose pipe as one of their challenges  The machine was developed by a spin-off from the University of Tokyo 's Jouhou System Kougaku lab , which Google recently revealed it had acquired .  In case of an emergency , Schaft unhooks a fire hose  Robot Atlas-Iam attempts the ladder challenge during the event in Florida  The team scored 27 points out of a possible 32 , putting it seven points ahead of second-placed IHMC Robotics , which used Atlas .  Scores were based on a system that awarded three points for completing a task 's primary objectives , and then a bonus point for doing so without any human intervention .  Schaft 's robot behaved almost perfectly , but lost points because ` the wind blew a door out of their robot 's hold and because their robotic creation was not able to climb out of a vehicle after it successfully navigated an obstacle course , ' reported the Japan Daily Press .  Four countries took part in the DARPA competition , including United States , Korea , China and of course Japan \n",

            "The moment when a young boy with severe hearing difficulties heard his mother 's voice for the very first time has been captured in a heartwarming video clip , which shows the youngster dissolving into a fit of giggles every time she speaks .  Entrepreneur Jennifer Colson Aprea , from Huntington Beach , California , posted the clip of her two-year-old son Ryan on her company 's Facebook page on Monday , revealing that her son had successfully been fitted with a cochlear implant which is enabling him to hear sounds for the first time in his life .  ` We 're heading home and it 's all good news after the mapping and activation , ' the mother-of-two , who founded cloth diaper brand Spray Pal , wrote .  What a laugh ! Ryan Aprea could n't stop giggling when he heard his mother Jennifer 's voice for the first time  Making a memory : The family captured the heartwarming moment on video and quickly shared the clip with their followers on Facebook  ` His brain is definitely receiving sound . The audiologist programmed the device at three different levels and we will gradually increase them throughout the week .  ` These are VERY low levels of sound input because we do n't want to overwhelm him and cause him to reject it . We filmed him each time we tested the new level , and he giggled like this when he heard my voice at every level which was the most amazing feeling because we could n't have asked for a better response .  ` As long as he is happy and loving it , we are happy ! If this develops into hearing comprehension and oral language down the road , that will be icing on the cake ! '  And it seems as though life is full of laughs for Ryan these days .  Just hours after posting the video of her son 's infectious giggling fits , Jennifer shared some photos of the toddler playing with all of his toys at home , adding that the experience was totally new to him now that he is able to actually hear them .  ` Every toy is new ! ' Hours after posting the video , Jennifer shared this image of her son enjoying the sounds of his toys at home  Feeling better : The youngster spent seven months in the neonatal intensive care unit after being born prematurely  ` Every toy is NEW ! ' she wrote . ` His face lighting up to the sounds is SO incredible ! This is such a happy day !! '  Ryan , who was born in October 2012 when he was just 25 weeks old , spent seven months in an intensive care unit before being allowed to return home with his family .  Since then , Jennifer has continued to document every stage of his life , sharing every success and struggle with her followers on Facebook , from Ryan 's first few weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit to his cochlear surgery in November .  ` If you 've been following our journey for a while , you probably already know that -LSB- Ryan -RSB- was born at 25 weeks , ' she wrote on the page in October .  ` Being a micropreemie is n't easy , especially when you end up staying in the NICU 7 months .

            "A flood of Biblical proportions just like in the story of Noah 's Ark may have actually happened , according to the oceanographer who found the Titanic .  Acclaimed underwater archaeologist Robert Ballard claims his team of researchers have uncovered evidence that suggests The Great Flood described in the Bible was actually based on real events .  Mr Ballard told how he investigated a controversial theory proposed by two scientists from Columbia University that there was a massive flood in the Black Sea region .  Scroll down for video  Under sea researcher Robert Ballard -LRB- left -RRB- , who found the Titanic , holds a picture of ancient jugs found off the coast of Israel and lost in a storm around 750 BC . He claims to have found evidence of The Great Flood  Genesis : A mural from the mid-16th century shows God ordering Noah to load two of every animal on to his ark to avoid the imminent Great Flood  In an interview with ABC News , he said around 12,000 years ago much of the world was covered in ice and the Black Sea had been a freshwater lake surrounded by farmland .  But when the glaciers began to melt during a warming period in the cycle of the Earth 's temperature around 5600BC water rushed toward the world 's oceans , Mr Ballard said .  This , he claimed , caused floods all around the world and water cascaded through Turkey 's Straits of Bosporus towards the Black Sea .  ` Where I live in Connecticut was ice a mile above my house , all the way back to the North Pole , about 15 million kilometers , that 's a big ice cube , ' he said .  ` But then it started to melt . We 're talking about the floods of our living history . The questions is , was there a mother of all floods ? '  His research follows a 1997 study by William Ryan and Walter Pitman who , drawing on archaeological and anthropological evidence , claimed that ` ten cubic miles of water poured through each day ' , and that the deluge continued for at least 300 days .  A working replica of Noah 's Ark built six years ago by Johan Huibers as a testament to his faith in the Bible in Schagen , the Netherlands  The animals coming were two by two : The story of Noah is described in the book of Genesis  Legendary : A manuscript of Noah 's Ark from the Nuremburg Bible 1493  More than 60,000 square miles of land were flooded , they said , and the lake 's level rose by hundreds of feet after merging with the Mediterranean , triggering mass animal migrations across Europe .  According to their study , the force of the water was two hundred times that of Niagara Falls , sweeping away everything in its path . It also transformed the Black Sea from an isolated freshwater lake surrounded by farmland into a saltwater inlet .  The researchers , whose findings have been backed up by carbon dating and sonar imaging , claimed that the story of Noah 's flood had its origin in this cataclysmic event .  Passed down : A 14th Century English manuscript showing Noah 's Ark at the end of flood  ` We went in there to look for the flood , ' Mr Ballard told ABC News . ` Not just a slow moving , advancing rise of sea level , but a really big flood that then stayed ... The land that went under stayed under . '  The team found an ancient shoreline which Mr Ballard believes is proof such an event did take place .  He believes that , by using carbon dating shells found along the shoreline four hundred feet below the surface , it took place around 5,000 BC .  ` It probably was a bad day , ' he said . ` At some magic moment , it broke through and flooded this place violently , and a lot of real estate , 150,000 square kilometers of land , went under . '  As the theory goes , the story of the disaster was passed down from generation to generation and eventually inspired the biblical account of Noah .  Noah is described in the Bible as a family man , a father of three , who is about to celebrate his 600th birthday .  ` In the early chapters of Genesis , people live 800 years , 700 years , 900 years , ' said Rabbi Burt Visotzky , a professor of Talmud and Rabbinics at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York .  ` Those are mythic numbers , those are way too big . We do n't quite know what to do with that . So sometimes those large numbers , I think , also serve to reinforce the mystery of the text . '  ` It probably was a bad day , ' he said . ` At some magic moment , it broke through and flooded this place violently , and a lot of real estate , 150,000 square kilometers of land , went under . '  Robert Ballard  Mr Ballard 's team has also found an ancient shipwreck , as well as ancient pottery . Although he does not think he will ever find Noah 's Ark , he believes he may find evidence of an ancient community washed away .  In the book of Genesis , God despairs of human corruption and decides to flood the Earth , instructing Noah to build an ark to save himself , his family and a pair of each animal species .  The Ark is described in the Book of Genesis as 300 cubits long , or approximately 450ft -LRB- 137m -RRB- , but despite many rumours and claims of sightings , no scientific evidence of its existence has ever been found .  ` The oldest shipwreck that we have discovered so far of that area is around 500 BC , classical period , ' Mr Ballard said . ` But the question is you just keep searching . It 's a matter of statistics . '  Mr Ballard , who led the international team that located the wreckage of the Titanic in 1985 , does not think he will ever find Noah 's Ark. .  However , Mr Ballard does think he may find evidence of a people whose entire world was washed away about 7,000 years ago . He and his team said they plan to return to Turkey next summer .  ` It 's foolish to think you will ever find a ship , ' Mr Ballard said , referring to the Ark. ` But can you find people who were living ? Can you find their villages that are underwater now ? And the answer is yes . '  According to Genesis 8:4 , it came to rest ` in the mountains of Ararat ' . Experts have agreed that these mountains are to be located in present-day Armenia and eastern Turkey .  Many biblical scholars believe the story of Noah and the Ark was inspired by the legendary flood stories of nearby Mesopotamia , in particular ` The Epic of Gilgamesh . '  These ancient narratives were already being passed down from one generation to the next , centuries before Noah appeared in the Bible .  ` The earlier Mesopotamian stories are very similar where the gods are sending a flood to wipe out humans , ' said biblical archaeologist Eric Cline .  ` There 's one man they choose to survive . He builds a boat and brings on animals and lands on a mountain and lives happily ever after ? I would argue that it 's the same story . '  Catastrophic events of this kind are not unique to the Bible . Some contemporary examples include the 2004 tsunami that wiped out villages on the coasts of 11 countries surrounding the Indian Ocean .  There was also Hurricane Katrina , described as the worst hurricane in United States history .  Scholars are n't sure if the biblical flood was larger or smaller than these modern day disasters , but they do think the experiences of people in ancient times were similar to our own .  ` If you witness a terrible natural disaster , yes , you want a scientific explanation why this has happened , ' said Karen Armstrong , author of A History of God .  ` But you also need to something that will help you to assuage your grief and anguish and rage . And it is here that myth helps us through that . '  Regardless of whether the details of the Noah story are historically accurate , the author believes this story and all the Biblical stories are telling us ` about our predicament in the world now .

            "By Eddie Wrenn  PUBLISHED :  08:04 EST , 18 September 2012   |  UPDATED :  09:56 EST , 18 September 2012  It has been perhaps the biggest phenomenon to ever hit the Internet , influencing everything from celebrity culture to politics to international relations .  But the site itself has changed little since launch - the Twitter team perhaps cautious of the criticism Facebook gets when it revamps a feature .  But today Twitter announced its biggest overhaul since its launch in 2006 , in particular introducing a ` cover photo ' to your user account , which will be seen by your followers whether they visit your page on the web , by mobile or by tablet .  The change brings Twitter a little closer to Facebook in terms of having a profile and a cover image , perhaps signalling Twitter 's intent as it continues pushing forward .  Twitter 2.0 : American TV host Ryan Seacrest , who helped announce the changes , shows off the new profile picture  The old style : Ashton Kutcher , one of Twitter 's biggest users , is yet to update , giving us a glimpse of the ` old ' Twitter  Twitter is a cultural phenomenon , with more than 140 million users , 340 million tweets sent every day , and a valuation of $ 8bn .  However , it is still a David to Facebook 's Goliath , which has a billion users , and a $ 100billion stock market flotation under its belt - indeed , the valuation went up by the same amount as Twitter 's total value after a speech by Mark Zuckerberg last week .  But Twitter has taken the headlines over the last few years , adored by celebrities and their legions of fans .  With internet users migrating towards a more mobile environment , Twitter has also completely revamped its iPad and phone apps , bringing additional features to what were previously quite basic apps .  Founded : 2006  Number of users : 140million  Value : $ 8billion  Key founder : Jack Dorsey  Best known for : Short communications , celebrity updates , contact with companies  Founded : 2004  Number of users : ~ one billion  Value : $ 100billion  Key founder : Mark Zuckerberg  Best known for : Staying in touch with friends and family , sharing images  Experts say the firm is also trying to boost the number of people using its mobile apps following competition from third party apps such as Tweetbot .  ` Twitter is trying to push people towards their mobile apps , ' said Stuart Miles of web site Pocket Lint .  ` Facebook has had cover pictures for a while , but Twitter has also had the ability to change your page - it 's just not many people used it . '  New profile pictures : The iPad app has been 're - built ' and will also support the new profile images  Announcing the changes on Twitter 's blog , the team said : ` Starting today you can make your presence on Twitter more meaningful with new Twitter profiles .  ` Upload an all-new header photo on mobile apps for iPad , iPhone and Android or twitter.com , and the same image will appear whenever anyone views your profile on the web or these apps .  ` You can upload your header photo , which appears above your Tweets , to express yourself instantly , anywhere . '  Welcome to the family : Twitter are showing off -LRB- from left to right -RRB- their new desktop version , and new versions for the iPad , iPhone and Android handsets  Other changes include photo streams that now appear below anyone 's most recent Tweets on iPhone , Android and iPad , which can be swiped through to see the photos of other users .  Celebrities such as Ryan Seacrest have already updated their profiles , having helped launched the changes on America 's Today Show .  The new versions of the apps bring in the website-based changes , such as the header photos , and there are also more options for updating your profile . \n",

            "By Ryan Gorman  PUBLISHED :   16:39 EST , 4 November 2013   | UPDATED :   19:27 EST , 4 November 2013  A Minnesota gnraphic designer who made fun of the NSA has found himself in a legal battle with the agency which is trying to ban his creation .  Drawing inspiration from the revelations made this year by Edward Snowden , Dan McCall , 38 , of Sauk Rapids , created a humorous T-shirt poking fun at the agency 's domestic spying programs , causing the spooks to send him a cease and desist letter .  ` When I got finished I thought , this is pretty good -- I thought it was fun , ' the NSA disagreed , forcing the shirts off the market -- now Mr McCall is fighting back , according to WCCO .  ` Peeping while you 're sleeping ' : This T-shirt drew the ire of NSA lawyers , who called it copyright infringement  Pick a size , any size : The shirts are a classic parody , McCall argues  The funnyman first took the circular NSA logo and emblazoned ` peeping while you 're sleeping ' across the bottom half .  He then put the phrase ` The only part of government that actually listens ' directly under the parodied seal and started making T-shirts .  The spy agency soon caught wind of the shirts and brought an end to the fun .  Calling it a violation of their intellectual property rights , the NSA 's cease and desist letter ordered him to immediately stop selling the shirts .  It 's a classic parody : Dan McCall , the graphic artist behind the shirt , says he is parodying the government - which is protected under the First Amendment  Can you hear me now ? : Spooks are n't fond of Mr McCall 's spoofing of their spying  Fighting bacl : Mr McCall is suing the spy agency for infringing on his right to freedom of speech  Mr McCall disagrees .  ` Because when you 're pointing straight at an organization or making fun at it , turning it on itself , that is classic parody , ' he told told the station .  Saying that he does n't want his children to grow up in a country where you ca n't poke fun at the government , Mr McCall told WCCO that his First Amendment rights are being violated .  The satirist-turned-activist has teamed up with Public Citizen , a Washington , D.C.-based advocacy group , to sue the NSA for the right to sell his shirts .  ` It 's bad enough that these agencies have us under constant surveillance ; forbidding citizens from criticizing them is beyond the pale , ' lawyer Paul Alan Levy said in an online statement .  It 's vital ` that we clarify whether or not these types of laws are consistent with the rights as Americans under the First Amendment , ' he told the station .  A message left for comment with Public Citizen has not yet been returned . \n",

            "After winning the support of New York Jets owner Woody Johnson , Mitt Romney now has the support of legendary quarterback John Elway , ahead of the first presidential debate tomorrow .  The former Denver Broncos quarterback hailed the Republican candidate as a ` proven leader ' and called Romney and his vice-president hopeful Paul Ryan as a ` comeback team ' .  The executive vice president of football operations for the Denver Broncos said : ` Governor Romney is a proven leader with the experience and background to turn around our struggling economy , ' The Weekly Standard reported .  Scroll down for video  Quarterback 's backing : Former Denver Broncos QB John Elway , right , introduces Mitt Romney during a campaign rally at the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum in Denver  Owner : Woody Johnson spoke candidly about everything from politics to the NFL referee lockout that was resolved last week when he appeared on Market Makers on Monday  ` In these tough economic times , we need a president who understands how to get America working again -- by standing on the side of taxpayers and small-business owners who do the real job creating .  ' I am endorsing Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan for President and Vice President because I know having the courage to make decisions and tackle challenges is what leads to results and real change . America needs a comeback team - Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are that team . '  A delighted Romney said he was thrilled to have the Hall of Fame footballer , who retired in 1999 and was statistically the second most prolific passer in the history of the NFL , backing him .  He said : ` Leaders come in many forms , and John Elway has always exemplified leadership , first as a quarterback for the Super Bowl champion Broncos , and now as an executive vice president for the team .  ` He 's had to overcome challenges during his career , and he knows what it takes to turn things around when things get tough .  Prolific passer : Romney says he 's thrilled to have Elway , a Hall of Fame footballer , who retired in 1999 , behind him  ` I 'm proud to have him on my team as we campaign to lead the comeback this nation desperately needs . '  Elway was joined by Woody Johnson - whose priorities go beyond the football field in an election season .  Appearing on Bloomberg TV 's Market Makers on Monday morning , Johnson wore the Jets team colors on his tie as he candidly spoke on everything from politics to the recent referee lockout .  But at the conclusion of the interview , Market Makers co-host Stephanie Ruhle asked Johnson which was more important - a winning season for the Jets , or an election victory for Mitt Romney ?  Strong words : Johnson , left , surprised hosts Stephanie Ruhle , center , and Erik Schatzker , right , when asked if a Romney victory or a winning season for the Jets was more important  Friends : Johnson , left , is pictured in 2003 at the White House with President George W. Bush , then-NFL Players Association director Gene Upshaw and then-NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue  Johnson responded : ` Well I think you always have to put country first . So I think it 's very very important - not only for us but in particular our kids and grandkids - that this election come off with Mitt Romney and -LSB- Paul -RSB- Ryan as president and vice president . '  Johnson , the Johnson & Johnson heir who also serves as one of Romney 's campaign finance co-chairs , is no stranger to the Republican cause .  In the past two days , Johnson held three major fundraisers for the Romney/Ryan ticket in New York .  Business Insider reported last month that Johnson donated $ 2,500 to Romney 's campaignin 2012 , but has raised millions in recent years for GOPers like Romney , George W. Bush and John McCain .  With the coach : Johnson , pictured right with Jets head coach Rex Ryan , called the team 's loss on Sunday ` absolutely unacceptable '  And if Johnson is putting more support behind Romney , it 's certainly showing on the football field , as the Jets suffered a heartbreaking blowout loss on Sunday at home .  The injury-plagued team was stopped dead in their tracks by a superior San Francisco 49ers , who won 34-0 .  Always slow to keep his temper under control , head coach Rex Ryan told reporters after Sunday 's game : ' I was going to say we got our butt kicked , but really , we got our ass kicked . There 's no two ways , ins or outs about it . '  Quarterback Mark Sanchez 's measly 13 completions in 29 attempts have some fans calling for him to take a seat on the bench and allow back-up Tim Tebow much more playing time .  Tebow said after the game : ` Me and Mark have a great relationship and we 're not worried about that . We 're not worried about what others are saying . '  Johnson , who called the loss ` absolutely unacceptable , ' said it did n't mean Tebow will start next week , but admitted ` it 's a question that 's going to be asked more frequently . '  Time for a change ? The Jets ' loss on Sunday has some calling for the team to bench quarterback Mark Sanchez , right , in favor of Tim Tebow , left  Watch video here \n",
